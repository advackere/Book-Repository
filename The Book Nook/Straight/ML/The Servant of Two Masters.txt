ACT ONE

SCENE ONE

A room in the house of Pantalona.

PANTALONA, CLARICE, SILVIO, DOTTORE, SMERALDINA.

SILVIO: Here is my hand and with it I give you all of my heart.

PANTALONA: Come on, don’t act shy. Give him your hand.

CLARICE: Caro [Dear] Silvio, here is my hand, and with it I promise to be your wife.

SILVIO: And I promise to be yours.

PANTALONA: Viva gli sposi! [Long live the bride and groom!]

DOTTORE: Bravissimi! [Very good!] Now there is no turning back. Soon you will be a man.

SILVIO: A man?

DOTTORE: A man.

SILVIO: A man!

DOTTORE: A homo sapien erectus maximus.

SILVIO: A homo erectus man!

PANTALONA: Now, for the celebration, we don’t need to invite friends or relatives … I’m sure Signor Dottore agrees. We do things without bells and whistles here. Let’s keep it simple, okay?

SILVIO: I desire nothing more than to be next to my dear bride.

SMERALDINA: [aside] Of course, where else would you be?

DOTTORE: My son is not a vain boy. He has a good heart and he loves your daughter.

PANTALONA: I must say this wedding was truly made in heaven, because if Signor Federigo Rasponi of Turin, my business associate, hadn’t died, Clarice would be marrying him and not [gesturing towards SILVIO] my dear son-in-law.

DOTTORE: Misfortune comes on horseback and returns on foot.

SILVIO: One man’s misfortune is another’s … fortune.

CLARICE: Oh, Silvio, you have such a way with words.

SMERALDINA: [aside] Yes, he’s a real Goldoni.

SILVIO: Grazie, mia cara. [Thank you, my dear.]

A knock is heard.

PANTALONA: Smeraldina, see who that is.

SMERALDINA: [shouting] Come in!

TRUFFALDINO enters.

TRUFFALDINO: Your humble and reverent servant at your service for all you good signori [sirs and madams]. Ah, what fine-looking people!

PANTALONA: Who are you? What do you want?

TRUFFALDINO: Scusi. [Excuse me.] I don’t want to interrupt, but who is the master of the house?

DOTTORE: I am.

PANTALONA: I am.

TRUFFALDINO: [to DOTTORE] You are the master of the house?

DOTTORE: Sì. I’m the master … but not of this house.

PANTALONA: I am the master of this house! What do you want?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t want to interrupt, but [to PANTALONA, referring to CLARICE] who is this fancy lady?

PANTALONA: My daughter.

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t want to interrupt, but … wow!

SMERALDINA: She’s engaged.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh. [To SMERALDINA] And who are you?

SMERALDINA: I’m her mistress, Signor.

TRUFFALDINO: Are you engaged?

SMERALDINA: Not yet.

TRUFFALDINO: That’s good. [To SILVIO] And who are you?

SILVIO: I am—

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t care.

PANTALONA: Okay, that’s enough. Who are you? Who sent you? And what do you want?

TRUFFALDINO: I am Truffaldino Batocchio from Bergamo. Who sent me? My master. And what do I want? Well, that’s easy.

TRUFFALDINO flirts with SMERALDINA.

PANTALONA: [to DOTTORE] This man is an idiot.

DOTTORE: He seems like more of a quack.

SILVIO: Yes, duck, duck goose!

CLARICE: He means charlatan.

SILVIO: I knew that.

PANTALONA: Zitti! [All of you, quiet!] And who is this master of yours?

TRUFFALDINO: Uffa. [Ugh.] It’s a long story. My master is Signor Federigo Rasponi from Turin.

CHORUS reacts.

Federigo Rasponi from Turin?

DOTTORE: Pantalona!

PANTALONA: Dottore …

CLARICE: Silvio!

SILVIO: Clarice!

SMERALDINA: Awkward.

TRUFFALDINO: Yeah, that guy. And he’s waiting outside.

PANTALONA: Get out of here, you madman! Signor Federigo Rasponi is dead.

TRUFFALDINO: What? My master is dead? He was alive when I left him. Are you sure he’s dead?

PANTALONA: Definitely dead.

TRUFFALDINO: Okay, well in that case, I better say my goodbyes. It was nice meeting you all. Ciao, arrivederci … [Goodbye, see you later …]

PANTALONA: What do you say, is he a fox or a fool?

DOTTORE: It seems to be a bit of both.

SMERALDINA: He’s foxy enough for me!

CLARICE: Silvio, if it were true that he were here for me, it would be a disaster.

SILVIO: So what? If he were alive and here in Venice, he would be too late.

TRUFFALDINO re-enters.

TRUFFALDINO: Hey, that’s not very nice, tricking people like that. That’s not how gentlemen behave!

PANTALONA: What?

TRUFFALDINO: Yeah, I’m talking to you. Signor Federigo Rasponi is alive. Not dead and he’s here.

PANTALONA: You’re crazy!

TRUFFALDINO: No, you’re crazy!

PANTALONA: Your mum’s crazy!

TRUFFALDINO: Don’t make me rapper-swear, dog!

PANTALONA: Hold me back or I’ll smash his face!

TRUFFALDINO: Hold me back or I’ll slap her with a donkey’s testicle.

DOTTORE: Per favore [Please], everybody stay calm.

CLARICE: Silvio mio [My Silvio], I am shaking all over.

SILVIO: Don’t worry, whatever happens, you’ll be mine.

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: Signora Pantalona, the courtesy and kindness that you have demonstrated in your correspondence does not correspond with the ill treatment that I have received in person. I send my servant to ask for permission to enter and you dare to make me wait outside for more than thirty minutes.

PANTALONA: Forgive me, but who—?

BEATRICE: Federigo Rasponi of Turin! La riverisco. [Your obedient servant.]

TRUFFALDINO: I told you. [To SMERALDINA] I’ll call you.

BEATRICE: [to TRUFFALDINO] Go and wait for me outside.

TRUFFALDINO exits.

PANTALONA: I’m astonished. But glad to see you are alive and well.

BEATRICE: I know, it was reported that I died in a duel. Thank heavens I was only wounded, and as soon as I was better I came to Venice as we’d already planned.

PANTALONA: I don’t know what to say.

DOTTORE: Don’t say anything more. This man is clearly an imposter.

BEATRICE: You are correct to doubt me, but I can easily prove my identity with this document.

She takes a document out of her pocket, holds it up and quickly puts it away again.

PANTALONA is convinced and parts SILVIO and CLARICE.

PANTALONA: Okay, that is proof enough.

CLARICE: Silvio, it’s a lost cause!

SILVIO: Life I am willing to lose, but not you, my love.

PANTALONA: This wedding is back on. Dear son-in-law, come to Mamma. Forgive me for doubting you.

CLARICE: Mamma, are you absolutely sure?

PANTALONA: Sure enough.

CLARICE: Oh, unhappy me! What will become of us?

SILVIO: Don’t worry I tell you, you are mine and I shall defend you!

SILVIO whips out his sword.

BEATRICE: Is this gentleman a relative of yours?

PANTALONA: Yes … he is my nephew.

SILVIO: No, Signor, I am not her nephew, I am Clarice’s fiancé.

DOTTORE: Bravo. [Good boy.] Speak your mind … but calmly.

BEATRICE: Clarice’s fiancé? Wasn’t she to be married to me?

PANTALONA: Oh yes, but you know, we thought you were dead, so she was given to Silvio. Anyway, you arrived just in time. Clarice is yours. If you want her, please take her.

CLARICE: [to BEATRICE] Are you happy to have a wife who has already promised her hand to another?

BEATRICE: Sì, I’m not fussy. [Aside] I want to have a bit of fun with this.

SILVIO: Signor, you are too late. Clarice is mine and I will take revenge on whoever tries to take her. I will fight them with this sword!

DOTTORE: Signora Clarice will marry my son. The law is clear on this. [Latin gibberish or grommelot.]1 You have caused us deep offence.

SILVIO: You haven’t heard the last of this.

DOTTORE and SILVIO exit.

BEATRICE: And you, dear bride, have you nothing to say?

CLARICE: I say, that you have come to torment me.

CLARICE exits.

PANTALONA: That little wag. [Aside to the audience] I said ‘wag’, not ‘wog’. ‘Wog’ is offensive so we don’t say the word ‘wog’. Okay? Don’t say ‘wog’.

Lazzo of ‘Don’t Say the Word’: All the characters repeat the phrase, ‘Don’t say the word “wog”’, including the audience in the game.

BEATRICE: Signora Pantalona, I feel for her, we cannot be too harsh. With time she may even come to like me. For now, let us go and discuss business.

BRIGHELLA enters.

BRIGHELLA: Pantalona, la riverisco [I revere you].

PANTALONA: Buongiorno [Good day], Brighella. You’ve come to discuss the menu for the wedding? Listen, nothing fancy, okay? Just a few pizzas and the house wine will do. Now let me introduce you to Signor Federigo Rasponi.

BRIGHELLA: Signor Federigo Rasponi? I thought he was dead?

PANTALONA: So did we; he’s not. It’s a long story. They don’t need to hear it again.

She gestures to the audience.

You know him?

BRIGHELLA: Yes, I was in Turin for three years. I even knew his sister [seeing BEATRICE] Beatrice … Ciao!

BEATRICE gestures behind PANTALONA’s back to keep quiet.

BRIGHELLA: I mean Federigo. Buongiorno, Signora … err, Signor. [Good day, Madam … um, Sir.]

BEATRICE: [aside] What the hell is he doing here? [To BRIGHELLA] Buongiorno, amico. [Good day, friend.] Tell me, what brings you to Venice?

BRIGHELLA: I am the proud owner of Brighella’s Inn. [To BEATRICE] Signora Beatrice, is that really you?

BEATRICE: Ah, that’s wonderful, congratulations.

She moves closer to him.

For the love of heaven, I beg of you, do not reveal my identity.

BRIGHELLA: Grazie [Thank you], and you will have to stay in my inn. [To BEATRICE] I will do my best.

PANTALONA: You two know each other?

BEATRICE: Sì, we do. Definitely.

BRIGHELLA: [to PANTALONA] Yes, of course. We go way, way back.

PANTALONA: Excellent. [To BRIGHELLA] So that’s definitely Rasponi?

BRIGHELLA: Sì, Signora. Definitely. Definitely.

PANTALONA: [to BEATRICE] Good. Now, about our business. Everything is in order and I will have your money very soon. Arrivederci. [See you later.]

PANTALONA exits.

BRIGHELLA: What’s going on, Signora Beatrice? I’ve put my neck on the line for you!

BEATRICE: Please don’t say a word to anyone, or betray me, dear Brighella. Dear friend. My dearest dear. My poor brother is dead, killed at the hand of my love, Florindo Aretusi. It’s a disaster! Do you remember how my brother did not want us to be together? It all happened so quickly—they started fighting and Federigo died and then Florindo, for fear of getting arrested, escaped. Heaven knows how much I grieved for the loss of my brother and how much I cried, but there is no bringing him back, and now I grieve for the loss of Florindo. I knew that he fled to Venice and so I decided to follow him. And here I am in the hope of finding my love. Signora Pantalona believes me to be Federigo. This isn’t a swindle. Pantalona’s money is rightfully mine! My brother is dead and I am his heir. So once we have settled the accounts, I will be paid and I can use the money to help Florindo. Understand that I cannot disclose my true identity otherwise I won’t achieve anything. As a man I am free and I want and need that freedom. It’ll be short-lived. But in the meantime things will sort themselves out. Look what love drives you to do.

BRIGHELLA: Nice story … So Pantalona’s money is yours, hey? Well then, you’ll be staying at Brighella’s Inn. [Aside] That’s my inn and it’s going to be very, very expensive.

BEATRICE: It’ll be my pleasure, dear, dear—

BRIGHELLA: Save it.

BEATRICE and BRIGHELLA exit.

SCENE TWO

Outside Brighella’s Inn.

TRUFFALDINO enters.

Lazzo of ‘Truffaldino’s Inner Conflict’: TRUFFALDINO battles with his angelic and demonic side. The text that follows may be used in this lazzo.

TRUFFALDINO: I have to wait here for my master … Oh, can you smell that? No, I must obey the master, but how can I when I am a slave to my stomach?

TRUFFALDINO’S DEVIL: Then you should listen to your stomach.

TRUFFALDINO’S ANGEL: If you listen to your stomach now you’ll regret it later when you have no master.

TRUFFALDINO’S DEVIL: But if you don’t go now, you will starve and you will be no use to your master.

TRUFFALDINO: Okay, I’ll go and eat then! Oh no, I just realised I don’t have any money. Uffa. [Ugh.]

FLORINDO enters with a ZANNI. The ZANNI carries his trunk.

The ZANNI groans.

FLORINDO: Here is a sign for an inn. Can’t you walk another four paces? For goodness sake!

The ZANNI groans.

I told you you were too weak, you have no strength.

TRUFFALDINO: [watching the scene] I could earn some money … [To FLORINDO] Signor, at your service.

FLORINDO: Sì, bravo. [Yes, good man.] Carry this trunk into that inn.

TRUFFALDINO: Leave it to me. This is how it’s done. [To the ZANNI] Get out of here.

FLORINDO: Bravissimo! [Very good!]

The ZANNI holds out his hand.

What? How much do I need to give you for ten paces?

The ZANNI continues to hold out his hand.

A ducat. Here is a Venetian ducat.

The ZANNI keeps his hand extended.

One must have the patience of a saint! Here are two ducats. Now duck off.

FLORINDO kicks him.

The ZANNI exits.

What airs it gives itself. It really did want a good bollocking. Now let’s see what inn this is. What inn is this?

TRUFFALDINO: A good one, Signor.

FLORINDO: And what do you do?

TRUFFALDINO: I’m a servant.

FLORINDO: Do you have a master at the moment?

TRUFFALDINO: At this moment? Right now? I do not have a master, no.

FLORINDO: You are without a master?

TRUFFALDINO: Here I am, you see I am without a master. [Aside] My master isn’t here so I’m not telling lies.

FLORINDO: Well, would you serve me then?

TRUFFALDINO: Do you want me to serve you?

FLORINDO: At least for the time I’m in Venice. Do you come recommended?

TRUFFALDINO: Highly.

FLORINDO: Do you have references?

TRUFFALDINO: Yes, a lot …

Beat.

… but not here.

FLORINDO: Well, I don’t usually hire without—

TRUFFALDINO: You can trust me, look at this honest face.

FLORINDO: I guess I can trust you.

TRUFFALDINO: Now, how much will you pay me?

FLORINDO: How much do you want?

TRUFFALDINO: A lot.

FLORINDO: Fine, I will pay you ten ducats a month.

TRUFFALDINO: Wow! I was thinking more like two or three, but I’ll take ten.

FLORINDO: Okay, first things first. I need to urgently see if letters have arrived for me at the post. Go to the post office for Turin and ask if there are letters for Florindo Aretusi. If there are, get them and bring them here immediately.

TRUFFALDINO: Okay, in the meantime order lunch!

FLORINDO: [aside] He seems a bit of a fool, but I don’t mind him. I’ll give him a chance.

FLORINDO exits.

SCENE THREE

TRUFFALDINO: Wow, ten ducats a month—what a sucker my new master is! There are so many servants looking for a master and I have found two! Yay. What the hell do I do now? I can’t serve both, can I? Why not? Wouldn’t it be a wonderful thing if I could serve both masters at the same time, earn two salaries and eat twice as much? I better do some work.

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: Where are you going?

TRUFFALDINO: Nowhere. I was waiting for you.

BEATRICE: Good. Go immediately to the gondola, get my trunk and take it into Brighella’s Inn.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Damn it! Not that inn! [To BEATRICE] In that inn, did you say?

Lazzo of ‘Word Play’: A word play game between TRUFFALDINO and BEATRICE with the words ‘in’, ‘inn’ and ‘Brighella’ and anything that rhymes with those words. TRUFFALDINO attempts to purposely cause confusion and distract BEATRICE into lodging elsewhere.

BEATRICE ends the lazzo.

BEATRICE: Are you some kind of dimwit? I said Brighella’s Inn. That one. That inn right there!

TRUFFALDINO: Keep your shirt on. Why didn’t you say so in the first place? [Aside] Can’t blame me for trying.

BEATRICE: Now go to the post office of Turin and ask if there are letters for Federigo Rasponi and Beatrice. Va, va, va. [Go, go, go.]

TRUFFALDINO: Got it. Letters for rigatoni and salsicce [sausages].

BEATRICE exits.

SCENE FOUR

SILVIO enters, sword drawn.

SILVIO: Where is your master?

TRUFFALDINO: My master is in his inn.

SILVIO: Go immediately henceforth into your master’s inn, tell him that I demand to speak with him. If he is a man of honour, he will face me, man to man.

TRUFFALDINO: But Signor—

SILVIO: Go now!

TRUFFALDINO: But I don’t know—

SILVIO: Less backchat or by heaven I’ll …

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Which one does he want?

SILVIO: Hurry or I shall give you a good beating!

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] I know. I’ll just send the first one I see …

SILVIO practises his sword techniques.

TRUFFALDINO exits and re-enters with FLORINDO.

FLORINDO has a napkin and wipes his mouth.

You ate without me?

TRUFFALDINO exits.

SILVIO: [aside] Federigo may have got away with his life once, but this time he won’t be so lucky!

FLORINDO: [aside] Is this the one who was enquiring after me? [To SILVIO] Signor, are you the one who was enquiring after me?

SILVIO: [aside] Where is Federigo and who is this? [To FLORINDO] Where is Federigo and who is this?

FLORINDO: [aside] I don’t know him, what could he possibly want from me? [To SILVIO] I don’t know you, what could you possibly want from me?

SILVIO: La riverisco. [I revere thee.]

FLORINDO: Riverito. [I accept that you have revered me.] My servant told me that you demanded to see me in a threatening manner.

SILVIO: He misunderstood. I told him I wanted to speak with his master.

FLORINDO: I am his master.

SILVIO: Either your servant looks like someone else whom I met this morning or he is serving another master.

He laughs.

FLORINDO: [aside] What an arse. [To SILVIO] Not a problem.

FLORINDO goes to leave.

SILVIO: [to FLORINDO] I was looking for a certain Federigo Rasponi—you wouldn’t happen to know him?

FLORINDO: [to SILVIO] Did you just say Federigo Rasponi?

SILVIO: Yes. And he lays claim to take my bride.

FLORINDO: Impossible, he cannot lay your bride, he is dead.

SILVIO: Yes, we all thought he was dead, but this morning he arrived in Venice alive and well.

FLORINDO: [aside] I am stunned.

SILVIO: [aside] I’m still stunned.

FLORINDO: Federigo Rasponi, I assure you, is dead!

SILVIO: Federigo Rasponi, I assure you, is alive!

FLORINDO: I’m pretty sure he’s dead!

SILVIO: I’m pretty sure he’s alive!

FLORINDO: Listen to me: you are being misled.

SILVIO: I am not. He is here, in the flesh, and has the documents to prove it.

FLORINDO: So he’s alive and here in Venice? [Aside] Cacca. [Shit.]

SILVIO: [aside] One of us must renounce our claim to Clarice or to our very own life.

FLORINDO: I don’t want your Clarice.

SILVIO: Sorry, I wasn’t talking to you, that was an aside.

FLORINDO: [to SILVIO] Quite alright. [Aside] He’s mad.

SILVIO: [aside] What a swine. [To FLORINDO] I am at your command.

FLORINDO: [to SILVIO] Your humble servant. [Aside] Bonehead.

SILVIO: [aside] Slimeball. [To FLORINDO] The humbling is all mine.

FLORINDO: All is well, my friend. [Aside] Birdbrain.

SILVIO: [aside and bowing] Humbled at your command. [To FLORINDO] What an ignoramus!

FLORINDO: I beg your pardon?

SILVIO: I said … what is your name-is?

FLORINDO: What is my name-is? Very well. My name is …

FLORINDO asks two audience members for their names and puts them together.

SILVIO: [inserting the improvised name] … pleased to make your acquaintance.

FLORINDO: And yours?

SILVIO: My name is …

FLORINDO: I don’t care. Arrivederci. [Goodbye.]

SILVIO exits.

[Aside] Federigo here? I escaped punitive measures only to find my nemesis here in Venice. How is it possible that my sword, whilst piercing his side and through his kidney, did not kill him? I was sure he was dead. He must be dead when this is what actually happened …

Lazzo of ‘The Sword Fight’: FLORINDO re-enacts the sword fight between he and Federigo by using the other players as ‘victims’. There is also opportunity for the actor to include audience members in this lazzo once all the players have been exhausted.

TRUFFALDINO enters with a ZANNI. The ZANNI is carrying Beatrice’s trunk.

TRUFFALDINO: Come on, hurry up … Oh hell! My other master is here! [To the ZANNI] Stand back, wait for me over there. Don’t move. Seriously. [To FLORINDO] Signor.

FLORINDO: Have you been to the post office and were there letters there for me?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor.

FLORINDO: Where are they?

TRUFFALDINO: In my hand. Give me a second, I will find them. [Aside] Oh no, I’ve mixed them up.

FLORINDO: Come on, give me my letters.

TRUFFALDINO: They’re not all yours. I’ve got someone else’s here too.

FLORINDO: Give them to me. [Aside] What do I see? A letter addressed to Beatrice Rasponi? Beatrice in Venice?

TRUFFALDINO: Did you find the letter for my friend?

FLORINDO: Who is this friend of yours?

TRUFFALDINO: He’s a servant whose name is … Pasquale.

FLORINDO: Whom does he serve?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t know, Signor.

FLORINDO: But if he told you to collect letters for his master he would have given you a name?

TRUFFALDINO: Naturally.

FLORINDO: What name did he give you?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t recall.

FLORINDO: What?

TRUFFALDINO: He wrote it on a piece of paper.

FLORINDO: And where is that piece of paper?

TRUFFALDINO: I left it at the post office.

FLORINDO: [aside] I am drowning in an ocean of confusion. [To TRUFFALDINO] Where does this Pasquale live?

TRUFFALDINO: How would I know, seeing he isn’t real … ly my friend?

FLORINDO: So how did you intend on giving him the letter?

TRUFFALDINO: That’s a good question. We were going to meet in piazza [the town square].

FLORINDO: [aside] I don’t know what to think.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] I don’t either. If I get away with this, it’ll be a miracle. [To FLORINDO] Can I please have that letter?

FLORINDO: No, I want to open this letter.

FLORINDO opens the letter.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh no! You shouldn’t have done that.

FLORINDO: I don’t care, this letter is of great interest to me.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Diavolo. [The devil.]

FLORINDO reads the letter and TRUFFALDINO looks over his shoulder.

What?! No pictures?

FLORINDO: [reading] ‘Illustrious Signora Beatrice. Your departure from the city has set tongues wagging … The court knows that you have escaped dressed as a man, and they are trying everything to find out where you are to make sure you are arrested. If I have any other news I will endeavour to let you know through the same avenue. Your humble and loyal servant, Fat Tony.’

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] That’s nice, reading someone else’s business.

FLORINDO: [aside] Beatrice left her home, dressed as a man to come looking for me! She really must love me. Oh, if only heaven would permit me to find her in Venice! [To TRUFFALDINO] Go, dear Truffaldino. Use all your skills to find Pasquale and his master. Find out where they are staying, bring Pasquale to me and I will slip you my generous tip.

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor! Give me the letter and I will find him.

FLORINDO: Hurry, this is absolutely urgent. [Aside] Beatrice in Venice, Federigo in Venice! I must find her first.

FLORINDO exits.

SCENE FIVE

SMERALDINA enters.

SMERALDINA: Hey there.

TRUFFALDINO: Hey, sweet cheeks … No, I can’t get distracted, I’ve got to fix this letter … But you look so pretty.

SMERALDINA: Grazie. [Thank you.]

TRUFFALDINO: I can’t look at your beauty right now because I really have to fix this letter … but you’re just so beautiful.

SMERALDINA: I got brains too, you know!

TRUFFALDINO: Does that mean you’re smart?

SMERALDINA: Yes, absolutely.

TRUFFALDINO: Well then, I’ve got a problem, maybe you can help me. What should I do about this letter? If I don’t fix it, my master will kill me.

SMERALDINA: Well, we can’t have that, can we? Let me see.

Lazzo of ‘Re-sealing the Letter’: SMERALDINA helps TRUFFALDINO re-seal the letter, grotesque methods may be used!

TRUFFALDINO: Wow. You really are smart and hot.

SMERALDINA: I know, I can’t believe I’m single.

She farts.

Whoops.

Lazzo of ‘The Farting Competition’.

TRUFFALDINO: Here comes my master, you better get out of here, I wouldn’t want you to get into trouble.

SMERALDINA: That’s sweet, but I can take care of myself.

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: [shouting] Truffaldino!

SMERALDINA: Ahh! He’s scary!

SMERALDINA exits.

The ZANNI groans, still holding the trunk or luggage.

BEATRICE: Is that my trunk?

TRUFFALDINO: Oh yeah, that is your trunk.

BEATRICE: Take it to my room.

TRUFFALDINO: Hurry up, take it to his room …

TRUFFALDINO berates and bosses the other ZANNI.

BEATRICE: Truffaldino.

TRUFFALDINO: Sì.

BEATRICE: Have you been to the post office?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor. [Yes sir.]

BEATRICE: And were there letters for me?

TRUFFALDINO: There was one for your sister.

BEATRICE: Good, where is it?

TRUFFALDINO: Here it is.

BEATRICE: This letter has been opened.

TRUFFALDINO: Opened?

BEATRICE: Opened and re-sealed with …

TRUFFALDINO: Oh no, really?

BEATRICE: Che schifo. [How disgusting.] How did this happen?

TRUFFALDINO: I have no idea how that happened. Who would do such a thing?

BEATRICE: You have no idea, huh? You little shyster! Who opened this letter?

TRUFFALDINO: I will tell you, Signor, I will confess the truth, it’s all very innocent. Actually, you’re going to laugh. It’s hilarious. At the post office there was a letter for me, and seeing as I can’t really read, instead of opening mine, I opened yours.

BEATRICE: If this were the truth, it wouldn’t be so bad.

TRUFFALDINO: The truth it is, Signor. It’s not so bad.

BEATRICE: Do you know the content of this letter?

TRUFFALDINO: No at all. The handwriting is terrible and there are no pictures.

BEATRICE: Did anyone see it?

TRUFFALDINO: [offended] Oh!

BEATRICE: Are you sure?

TRUFFALDINO: [deeply offended] Well I never!

BEATRICE: [aside] He better not be lying.

She reads.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Phew. The deception’s been sealed!

BEATRICE: [aside] Fat Tony is a faithful servant. I owe him my life. [To TRUFFALDINO] Okay, now I need to take care of some business. Here are the keys. Go in the inn, open my trunk and air out my clothes. [Aside] Where is Pantalona? I need my money.

BEATRICE exits.

TRUFFALDINO: That went well. I’m pretty crafty. I am worth one hundred ducats more than I was before! In fact my star sign says I’m going to come into money today. But first … vado a mangiare [I’m going to eat].

PANTALONA enters.

PANTALONA: You, Zanni. Is your master home?

TRUFFALDINO: Signora, no, he isn’t.

PANTALONA: Do you know where he is?

TRUFFALDINO: No.

PANTALONA: Is he coming home to eat?

TRUFFALDINO: I hope so!

PANTALONA: Look, I don’t have time to wait. I’ve got things to do. Here, give this to your master. It’s one hundred ducats.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] See I told you.

PANTALONA exits.

[Calling after PANTALONA] Wait! Which master am I supposed to give it to?! Oh well, it can wait. First … vado a mangiare. [I’m going to eat.]

FLORINDO enters.

FLORINDO: Truffaldino, have you found Pasquale?

TRUFFALDINO: Uffa! [Ugh!] No, Signor, I haven’t found him. But I found someone who gave me a bag of one hundred ducats.

FLORINDO: One hundred ducats? What for?

TRUFFALDINO: Are you expecting money?

FLORINDO: Err yes, from a local merchant. What did they say, the person who gave this to you?

TRUFFALDINO: They said, [imitating PANTALONA] ‘Here, give this to your master’.

FLORINDO: Am I not your master?

TRUFFALDINO: Of course. [Aside] Oh, cacca [shit], what if it’s for the other one?

FLORINDO: Oh, and don’t forget about Pasquale.

TRUFFALDINO: Who? Oh yes, I’ll look for him after lunch. Let’s go eat.

FLORINDO and TRUFFALDINO exit.

SCENE SIX

A room in Pantalona’s house.

PANTALONA and CLARICE enter.

PANTALONA: Signor Federigo will be your husband and that is that! I have given my word and I won’t be told what to do by you or anyone else.

CLARICE: You may be the boss of me, but you are not the boss of my heart!

PANTALONA: Amore, tesoro [Love, sweetheart], when Signor Federigo asked for your hand, you said nothing. You should have said something, but you didn’t, and now it is too late.

CLARICE: I was blindsided and dumbstruck.

PANTALONA: Good. So do the same now, keep your mouth shut. Okay, sweetie pie, darling?

CLARICE: But I cannot, cara Mamma [dear Mother].

PANTALONA: Why not?

CLARICE: Federigo, I certainly won’t marry.

PANTALONA: Is he that bad?

CLARICE: He is odious to my eyes.

PANTALONA: Even if I teach you how to like him?

CLARICE: How, Mamma?

PANTALONA: Now when a man loves a woman …

PANTALONA whispers to CLARICE.

CLARICE: Oh, Mamma, that’s grotesque …

PANTALONA continues to whisper.

What about me?

SMERALDINA enters.

SMERALDINA: Signora Pantalona, Signor Federigo is here. He wants to pay his respects.

PANTALONA: Well, let him in, mi casa es su casa [my home is your home (in Spanish)].

CLARICE: What torture it is to live in this oppressive fascist matriarchal house.

SMERALDINA: What’s wrong, Signora Clarice? Are you crying? What on earth for? Have you not seen what a spunk Signor Federigo is? If I were to come across such fortune, I would not be crying, oh no, I would be smiling from ear to ear!

PANTALONA: Clarice, don’t let him see you crying.

CLARICE: But my heart feels as though it has been torn out of my breast, thrown into the rubbish, ended up in landfill and eaten by sewer rats.

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: Riverisco la Signora Pantalona. [I revere Madam Pantalona.]

PANTALONA: Riverita. [Revered.] Did you get the money?

BEATRICE: No.

PANTALONA: I gave it to your servant—you said he was trust—

BEATRICE: There is no need to worry—I haven’t seen him as yet and he will give it to me when I return home. Why is Signora Clarice crying?

PANTALONA: She’s got hay fever.

CLARICE: Actually, for your information, the love of my life, my soul, my everything has been torn away from me and I’m being forced to marry you—a capitalist banker leech who is probably responsible for the Global Financial Crisis. Because in this society women are a commodity and marriage is a financial transaction between business partners. That is why you see my eyes bleed, not because I have allergies.

PANTALONA: Maybe she ate something bad.

BEATRICE: Right. Signora Pantalona, let’s see if I can make her feel better—please allow me a moment alone with Clarice,

PANTALONA: Sì Signor! Take your time. [To CLARICE] Behave and keep your mouth shut.

PANTALONA exits.

BEATRICE: Signora Clarice—

CLARICE: Stay back and don’t dare solicit me!

BEATRICE: Such severe words for your friend, I mean husband-to-be.

CLARICE: I will only go to the altar kicking and screaming. You’ll have my hand but not my heart.

BEATRICE: Yes, you’re right. Yet, I hope to appease you.

CLARICE: And I hope to abhor you for eternity.

BEATRICE: If you knew me you wouldn’t say such things.

CLARICE: I know you well enough as the destroyer of my happiness.

BEATRICE: But I have the means to console you.

CLARICE: You’re wrong, only Silvio can console me.

BEATRICE: Certainly, I cannot give you that which Silvio can provide. But I can make you happy.

CLARICE: It seems clear to me, Signor, that despite my acerbic tongue you still want to torment me.

BEATRICE: [aside] I haven’t got the heart to see her in such pain. [To CLARICE] Signora Clarice, I have a secret to tell you.

CLARICE: I cannot guarantee I will keep it, so don’t confide in me.

BEATRICE: Your sternness makes it difficult for me to please you.

CLARICE: You stubbornness makes me sick to look at you.

BEATRICE: You are wrong.

CLARICE: You are!

BEATRICE: And to convince you—

CLARICE: Don’t bother.

BEATRICE: I will now speak openly—

CLARICE: I’m not listening … la, la, la, la.

BEATRICE: You don’t want me, and I don’t want you.

CLARICE: That’s right!

BEATRICE: You have given your hand to Silvio and I have given my hand to another.

CLARICE: Good!

BEATRICE: I am not Federigo Rasponi—

CLARICE: Whatever.

BEATRICE: —but his sister, Beatrice.

BEATRICE opens her shirt.

CLARICE Oh.

BEATRICE: It’s okay, things are certainly not ordinary.

CLARICE: No, they are extraordinary.

BEATRICE: Swear that you can keep my secret.

CLARICE: Would you permit me to tell Silvio?

BEATRICE: Absolutely not! Your Silvio is an idiot.

CLARICE: I know, but I love him.

BEATRICE: I trust you, Signora Clarice.

CLARICE: I promise I won’t say a word.

BEATRICE: Grazie. [Thank you.]

CLARICE: And I will be your friend and ally.

BEATRICE: And I too will swear my eternal friendship.

CLARICE and BEATRICE embrace.

PANTALONA enters.

PANTALONA: Bravi! [Good!] Let’s set the date for the wedding immediately!

CLARICE: Mamma, why the rush?

PANTALONA: What! Nooky-nooky in secret and I don’t need to rush? No, no, no, we don’t want any disgrazie or ‘accidents’. [Aside to the audience] In Italian we say ‘disgrazia’ when a little slag brings great shame onto the family by getting knocked up. But to say ‘slag’ is offensive, so we won’t say the word ‘slag’.

Lazzo of ‘Don’t Say the Word’: All the characters repeat the phrase, ‘Don’t say the word “slag”’, including the audience in the game.

PANTALONA: [to CLARICE and BEATRICE] Tomorrow you will be married.

PANTALONA exits.

CLARICE: Ah, Signora Beatrice, I’m out of the frying pan and into the fire.

BEATRICE: Be patient, anything can happen, except a marriage between us …

A ZANNI enters and sweeps them off the stage to signify the end of the Act.

A musical interlude or dance.

END OF ACT ONE

1 

In Goldoni’s commedia, Il Dottore spoke Latin, the language of an educated and learned scholar. So a Latin gibberish or grommelot may have been used to embellish this character’s speech. However, a contemporary audience may not easily identify with Latin and therefore an Italian-sounding grommelot may be more appropriate.



ACT TWO

SCENE ONE

Pantalona’s courtyard.

PANTALONA enters.

SILVIO and IL DOTTORE enter.

SILVIO: [to DOTTORE] I beg of you, leave me be.

DOTTORE: Stop. Speak to me.

SILVIO: I am furious. I am beside myself. Pantalona must honour our contract or else …

DOTTORE: Calm down. It is madness to allow your anger to drive your actions.

SILVIO: Whoever treats us Lombardis like this doesn’t deserve our respect.

DOTTORE: Silvio, let me speak to her. I may be able to make her see reason and understand her obligation. Silvio, look at Papà. Stand over there and wait and I’ll sort this out.

SILVIO: Fine.

SILVIO moves away and waits.

DOTTORE: Ah, Signora Pantalona, la riverisco [I revere thee].

PANTALONA: Your servant.

PANTALONA bows.

DOTTORE: Pantalona, you will assure us that Signora Clarice will be Silvio’s wife. Sì?

PANTALONA: I—

DOTTORE: Stop, please there is no need for explanation or apologies. I understand the predicament you found yourself in. All is forgotten and forgiven.

PANTALONA: Yes, but I made a promise to Signor Federigo—

DOTTORE: I understand. He took you unexpectedly, you had no time to reflect and you didn’t realise the grave insult that you made towards our house.

PANTALONA: Insult?

DOTTORE: I know what you mean to say, it seemed that the promise with the fellow from Turin was indissoluble because it was done as a contract. But that was a contract between you and him, and our contract has been confirmed by you, me, my son and the young lady as well.

PANTALONA: True but—

DOTTORE: You know very well that in matters of matrimony [grommelot].

PANTALONA: Non capisco. [I don’t understand.]

DOTTORE: Young ladies are not to be sacrificed. For me, I have said all there is to say.

PANTALONA: Have you finished?

DOTTORE: I have finished.

PANTALONA: Can I speak?

DOTTORE: Speak!

PANTALONA: I—

DOTTORE: If it’s a matter of money, this can be fixed easily.

PANTALONA: Can I speak?

DOTTORE: Speak.

PANTALONA: Your argument is good, Dottore, but in this case, no. She marries Rasponi and that is final.

DOTTORE: Inconceivable! And you would support such a marriage!?

PANTALONA: Yes. My daughter is happy.

DOTTORE: Come ti permette! [How dare you!] How dare you treat us like this! If you weren’t sure of Signor Federigo’s Rasponi’s death, you shouldn’t have made a promise to my son. And if with him you made a promise, you must with him keep that promise, above all else, and unpromise the promise you made to Rasponi. The news of his death and resurrection should have been enough justification to break the contract, even for him. Your obligation was to tell him that he has no right to Clarice. And the contract we made this morning with Clarice and my son, coram testibus [before witnesses (in Latin)], could not have been dissolved by your words or anyone else’s. I would give my left knee for this new contract to be annulled and oblige your daughter to take him as her husband. But I would be ashamed to have in my house a daughter-in-law of such ill repute! Because she is the daughter of a woman, a woman with no honour, no morals and no dental hygiene—that’s you! Signora Pantalona, remember you did this to me, and to the house of Lombardi. The time will come when you will get your just desserts. Yes, the time will come, omnia tempus habent [all things have their season (in Latin)].

PANTALONA: I don’t give a flying fig. Go jump. The house of Rasponi is worth one hundred houses of Lombardi. Rasponi is an only son and rich, just how I like them.

SILVIO comes out from hiding and berates PANTALONA whilst waving his sword.

SILVIO: Let him keep his temper, I can’t!

SILVIO charges.

DOTTORE holds him back.

PANTALONA: In my house you threaten me like this!

SILVIO: So come out of your house!

PANTALONA: I am shocked!

SILVIO: You are shocking!

PANTALONA: A women of my standing is to be respected!

SILVIO: You are a vile low-life plebeian!

PANTALONA: And you are a coward and a spoilt twit!

SILVIO: I swear to heaven, I don’t know what’s holding me back.

DOTTORE: It is me, I am holding you back.

SILVIO: Oh, yeah.

SILVIO pushes DOTTORE away and charges.

PANTALONA: Aiuto! [Help!]

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: I am here to defend you.

SILVIO: Just the man I want to fight. En guard!

BEATRICE: Bring it.

PANTALONA: Aiuto! [Help!]

PANTALONA exits.

DOTTORE: Aiuto! [Help!]

DOTTORE exits.

BEATRICE and SILVIO fight.

BEATRICE wins. She points the sword at SILVIO’s chest.

CLARICE enters.

CLARICE: Stop!

BEATRICE: Bella Clarice [Beautiful Clarice], at your request I will spare Silvio’s life, and in turn, remember your promise to me.

BEATRICE exits.

SCENE TWO

CLARICE: Dear Silvio, you are safe, my love.

SILVIO: Dear Silvio? Dear lover disdained, fiancé betrayed. Deceitful, treacherous.

CLARICE: Silvio, I don’t deserve your reproaches. I love you. I adore you. I am faithful.

SILVIO: Faithful? Do you call it faithful to promise your hand to another lover? Liar!

CLARICE: But I didn’t. I would die before I abandon you.

SILVIO: Then what is this vow you made to him?

CLARICE: The vow does not oblige me to marry him.

SILVIO: So what have you promised?

CLARICE: Dear Silvio, please understand I cannot tell you.

SILVIO: Dear Silvio. Why?

CLARICE: Because I swore to keep silent.

SILVIO: And that’s a sign of your infidelity.

CLARICE: No, I am innocent.

SILVIO: The innocent don’t keep dark secrets.

CLARICE: Yet I will be guilty if I speak.

SILVIO: And you say you don’t love him. I don’t believe you. You savage, deceitful liar.

CLARICE: If I didn’t love you I wouldn’t have defended your life.

SILVIO: And I would hate my life if I were to be grateful to you for saving it.

CLARICE: I love you with all my heart.

SILVIO: I abhor you with all my soul.

CLARICE: I will die if you don’t placate.

SILVIO: I would rather see you bleed than see you disloyal.

CLARICE takes up the sword.

Yes, that sword will vindicate the wrongs done to me.

CLARICE: So savage with your Clarice?

SILVIO: You have taught me that cruelty.

CLARICE: Then I will please you.

She points the sword to her chest.

Yes, the pain will kill me, I will die and you will be happy. But one day you will discover my innocence, and then it will be too late. You will shed tears for my misfortune and your barbarous cruelty.

SMERALDINA enters.

SMERALDINA: Stop. What the hell are you doing?

She takes the sword from CLARICE.

[To SILVIO] And you cowardly dog, you see a young woman about to top herself and you just stand there staring, as if you were watching a scene from a commedia! I just can’t understand you would have left her to die! [To the audience] Look here, what a fine specimen of man, such a catch, that women disembowel themselves for him. [To CLARICE] Signora mistress, doesn’t he want you anymore? Well, if that’s the case, he doesn’t deserve you. Let him go to hell and you come with me. For there is no shortage of men here in Venice, I can get you a dozen by tonight.

CLARICE: Ingrate, is it possible that my death does not even move you? Where is your heart?

Lazzo of ‘Wrenching the Heart’: SILVIO wrenches his heart and mimes it being destroyed in various ways.

SMERALDINA: You men make me sick! You and you and you and you too. [To an audience member] Not you, you’re cute. [To SILVIO] Oh, poor Silvio. Your little tiny ego has been hurt? [To CLARICE] And you, be a woman, stand up. You can do much better. You got brains, so use them!

CLARICE exits.

SILVIO: You are crazy, do you think she really wanted to kill herself?

SMERALDINA: [aside to the audience] Listen to this guy! [To SILVIO] If I hadn’t arrived in time she would have been finished.

SILVIO: All a fabrication of your minds.

SMERALDINA: You mean us women? Yes, if we were like you men … I would say, like the saying goes: women are from Venus and men have a penis. Men and women have a reputation for being unfaithful and both commit infidelities, but people gossip about women and say nothing about men! We are criticised, and of you men, no-one says a word. You know why? Because the laws have been written by men for men, and women always get the shorter end of the stick—pun intended. If the laws were made by women, everything would be different. If I were in charge I would decree that all men who have been unfaithful must carry a branch from a tree in their hands … and then you’ll see that all cities would become forests!

SMERALDINA exits.

SILVIO: Yes, Clarice is unfaithful. And I will continue to seek revenge. That worthless scum will die and that ungrateful wag will see her love in his blood.

CHORUS: Boo!

SILVIO exits.

SCENE THREE

Brighella’s Inn.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, what bad luck! Out of both of my masters neither has turned up for lunch. It’s been two hours since the clock struck midday and neither is to be seen. I bet they both turn up together and then I’ll be in a pickle. I won’t be able to serve both and I’ll be found out. Calm down, here comes one now.

FLORINDO enters.

FLORINDO: So have you found this Pasquale?

TRUFFALDINO: I thought we were looking for him after lunch?

FLORINDO: [aside] I wonder how I can find out if Beatrice is here?

TRUFFALDINO: What about lunch?

FLORINDO: I can’t possibly eat right now. My heart is in my stomach.

TRUFFALDINO: I wish your heart was in my stomach.

FLORINDO: [aside] I’ll go to the post office, maybe I’ll get some more information.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, my stomach!

FLORINDO: I’m leaving to take care of urgent business. I’ll eat later this evening. Meet me in piazza [the town square] with news about Pasquale. Oh, and put this purse in my trunk.

FLORINDO exits.

TRUFFALDINO: If he doesn’t want to eat, fine, but I’m not one for fasting. Vado a mangiare … [I’m going to eat …]

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: Truffaldino!

TRUFFALDINO: Uffa. [Ugh.]

BEATRICE: Did Signora Pantalona give you a purse with one hundred ducats?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor.

BEATRICE: Why then didn’t you give it to me?

TRUFFALDINO: Was it meant for you?

BEATRICE: What did she say when she gave it to you?

TRUFFALDINO: She said, [imitating PANTALONA] ‘Give this to your master’.

BEATRICE: And who is your master?

TRUFFALDINO: You are. Ah, so then it is yours! Ecco. [Here it is.]

BEATRICE: Is it all there?

TRUFFALDINO: I haven’t touched a cent.

BEATRICE: [aside] I’ll count it, just to be sure.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Problem solved. Oh no, what will the other one say? Well, if it wasn’t his in the first place he won’t say a thing.

BEATRICE: Truffaldino, tell Brighella I have a friend dining with me and to quickly prepare a table.

TRUFFALDINO: How many dishes did you want?

BEATRICE: Signora Pantalona is not a fancy woman. Tell him a few pizzas and the house wine will be fine.

TRUFFALDINO: Got it. [Aside] Now he will see what a great waiter I am too.

BEATRICE: Oh, and take this and put it in my trunk. It is a cheque for four thousand ducats.

TRUFFALDINO: Duc me! Sì Signor.

BEATRICE exits.

SCENE FOUR

TRUFFALDINO: I must make a good impression. I want to show my master my mad skills. I’ll put this away first and then … No I’ll put it away later, I don’t want to waste time. Hey! Anyone there?

BRIGHELLA enters.

BRIGHELLA: What is it, Truffaldino?

TRUFFALDINO: My master has a friend for lunch and he’d like me to order.

BRIGHELLA: I can quickly whip something out.

TRUFFALDINO: Okay, tell me what have you got?

BRIGHELLA: For two people, we can do two servings of four dishes, okay?

TRUFFALDINO: Or five of six or six of eight, nine of ten is fine too. What are the specials?

BRIGHELLA: For entrée we have a zucchini flower soup with shards of tender organic venison carpaccio, seasoned with pink mustard fruits and saltbush peppercorns. For main we have a duck terrine risotto lasagne with saffron peas and a basil butter reduction emulsion. Or a braised goat ball … with porcini and rosemary jus on a bed of deconstructed spaghetti marinara polenta. For dessert you have a choice between the bouncy lavender panna cotta napping on fairy floss sorbet or the salty sweet onion marmalade praline beer jelly topped with champagne foam at the mouth.

TRUFFALDINO accidentally eats the cheque while BRIGHELLA reels off the specials.

TRUFFALDINO: Delizioso. [Delicious.]

BEATRICE and PANTALONA enter.

BEATRICE: What are you doing?

TRUFFALDINO: Nothing.

He spits out the document.

BEATRICE: Is that my cheque?

TRUFFALDINO: What cheque?

He continues to spit the document.

BEATRICE: That cheque!

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, that cheque! Oh no! That cheque. [To BEATRICE] Forgive me. I’ll put it back together.

BEATRICE: You imbecile! You deserve a good beating. What do you say, Signora Pantalona, have you ever seen such stupidity?

PANTALONA: Don’t worry, I’ll write you another.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, grazie. [Thank you.] See, there’s no problem, she’ll write you another.

BEATRICE: That’s not the point! You are an idiot! A reckless fool! Il batocchio per favore. [The whacking stick please.]

TRUFFALDINO: Have mercy, Signor. The trouble came because Brighella was trying to be all fancy and all I wanted to do was to give you the best service …

BEATRICE: Zitto! [Be quiet!]

TRUFFALDINO: It wasn’t my fault.

BEATRICE: Zitto, I said, and bend over.

TRUFFALDINO: [to the audience] Hang on, is this going to hurt? [To BEATRICE] Okay, I’m ready.

BEATRICE whacks him.

PANTALONA: What’s for dinner?

BRIGHELLA: Is there something in particular that you would like?

PANTALONA: Get me some soft polpette [meatballs], I have an abscess in my tooth. See?

BEATRICE: Did you get that?

BRIGHELLA: Sì, polpette per Pantalona. [Yes, meatballs for Pantalona.]

BEATRICE: Tell Truffaldino to come and serve us.

PANTALONA: [to BEATRICE] Caro Signor [Dear sir], I owe you my life! I still shake with fear. If you had not been there, that savage would have killed me.

BEATRICE: You’re welcome, Signora Pantalona.

TRUFFALDINO returns.

Lazzo of ‘Serving Dinner’.

In this scene TRUFFALDINO serves both masters at the same time. First BEATRICE and then FLORINDO. It is crucial that he keep them apart in order for them not to discover that he is serving both.2

BEATRICE: [to TRUFFALDINO] I would like less folly and more attention.

TRUFFALDINO: Coming right up.

FLORINDO enters.

FLORINDO: Where are you going?

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Oh, cacca. [Shit.]

FLORINDO: Where are you going with that dish?

TRUFFALDINO: I was putting it on the table, Signor.

FLORINDO: For whom?

TRUFFALDINO: For you, Signor.

FLORINDO: Why are you serving me before I arrived?

TRUFFALDINO: I saw you arrive, through the window. [Aside] Not bad. I had to pull something out of my arse!

FLORINDO: And you start with the meat before the soup?

TRUFFALDINO: Well, in Venice the meat comes out first.

FLORINDO: I am accustomed to different customs, I want the soup first. Send it back.

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor.

FLORINDO: And hurry up, I want to have a nap and I want you to find Pasquale.

TRUFFALDINO: Subito! [Immediately!]

FLORINDO: [aside] Will I ever find Beatrice? Oh, my heart, how it longs!

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Wouldn’t it be brilliant if I could serve both masters at their table, at the same time?

He looks at a plate of meatballs.

Meatballs?! Oh hell, which of my masters ordered these?

Lazzo of ‘Dividing and Eating Meatballs’.

FLORINDO: Truffaldino! I’m off to take a nap, wake me when you have found Pasquale. Oh, Beatrice!

BEATRICE: Truffaldino! I’m off to escort Pantalona home. Air out my clothing!

FLORINDO and BEATRICE exit.

TRUFFALDINO: Hurray! I served two masters and neither one was none the wiser. Now I’ve served two and I will eat for four!

The ZANNI sweep the mess offstage.

A musical interlude as they do so.

SCENE FIVE

The street outside Brighella’s Inn.

SMERALDINA enters.

SMERALDINA: Look at what my mistress makes me do! Sending me to deliver a message to a gentleman in his inn. Serving a woman in love sucks. I tell you, for such a smart girl she is capable of such stupidness. And I don’t quite understand why she claims to love Signor Silvio so much that she’s ready to disembowel herself, and in the next moment she’s sending secret messages to another! I know: maybe one for the summer and one for winter! If that were the case, it wouldn’t be a bad idea. Okay, I better deliver this message. Hey! Anyone there?

A ZANNI enters.

Tell me, is there a Federigo Rasponi staying here?

The ZANNI nods.

I need to give him a message.

The ZANNI looks at the audience.

How dare you! I am the servant of his bride-to-be.

The ZANNI gestures for her to enter.

Oh no, I won’t. You better tell his servant to come out here. The cute one.

TRUFFALDINO enters.

TRUFFALDINO: Who’s asking for me?

SMERALDINA: It’s me, Signor. Oh, I’m interrupting. It looks like you’re eating.

TRUFFALDINO: I was.

SMERALDINA: I’m sorry.

TRUFFALDINO: I’m not. My belly is full and those pretty eyes are just the thing to help me digest.

SMERALDINA: [aside] He’s so cute!

TRUFFALDINO: What can I do for you, my dear?

SMERALDINA: [aside] He called me dear! [To TRUFFALDINO] My mistress wants me to deliver this message to Signor Federigo Rasponi.

TRUFFALDINO: Of course, I will bring it to him. But before I go, I have a message too.

SMERALDINA: From whom?

TRUFFALDINO: From a gentleman. Do you know of a certain Truffaldino Batocchio?

SMERALDINA: He sounds familiar … [Aside] I wonder if it’s him?

TRUFFALDINO: He’s a handsome guy. Dark hair, muscles, real smart and talks good.

SMERALDINA: I don’t know him.

TRUFFALDINO: But he knows you and is in love with you.

SMERALDINA: You’re pulling my leg.

TRUFFALDINO: I’d like to. No, I’m not! And if he knew you felt the same he would present himself.

SMERALDINA: Well, if I saw him and liked him, I wouldn’t say no.

TRUFFALDINO: Great. I’ll go get him.

SMERALDINA: [aside] Oh, it’s not him then.

TRUFFALDINO exits and re-enters. He flirts with SMERALDINA before exiting again.

[Aside] Non capisco. [I don’t get it.]

TRUFFALDINO re-enters.

TRUFFALDINO: Did you see him?

SMERALDINA: Who?

TRUFFALDINO: The man who is in love with your beauty.

SMERALDINA: I only saw you. Do you have the hots for me? Is it you?

TRUFFALDINO: Ta-dah!

SMERALDINA: Why didn’t you say so in the first place?

TRUFFALDINO: I’m a bit shy.

SMERALDINA: [aside] A stone could fall for him.

TRUFFALDINO: So what do you say?

SMERALDINA: I’m shy too.

TRUFFALDINO: So let’s get together. It’ll be marriage between two shysters.

SMERALDINA: Yeah, let’s get married. Hang on.

TRUFFALDINO: Why?

SMERALDINA: Look, I know this is stupid, but the only way I can marry you is for you to ask my master for permission.

TRUFFALDINO: Fine, I will do that.

SMERALDINA: Good. Now go deliver that message.

TRUFFALDINO: Hang on, I wouldn’t want to deliver bad news, he could get mad at me.

SMERALDINA: It could be a love letter.

TRUFFALDINO: That would be good.

SMERALDINA: Or they could be breaking up.

TRUFFALDINO: That would be bad.

SMERALDINA: We could open it and find out.

TRUFFALDINO: Good idea.

He rips it open.

Can you read?

SMERALDINA: Not really.

BEATRICE and PANTALONA enter.

BEATRICE: What’s that?

TRUFFALDINO: Nothing.

BEATRICE: Let me see. What?! This is a message addressed to me. You always open my mail now?

TRUFFALDINO: Not always, but sometimes. I mean no.

PANTALONA: [to SMERALDINA] What are you doing here?

SMERALDINA: Nothing, madam, the mistress is looking for you.

BEATRICE: This is a note from Signora Clarice, in which she warns me about Silvio’s mad jealousies. Who opened this note?

TRUFFALDINO: Not me.

SMERALDINA: Not me.

PANTALONA: Who brought it here?

SMERALDINA: Truffaldino was delivering it to his master.

TRUFFALDINO: And Smeraldina was delivering it to Truffaldino.

SMERALDINA: [aside to TRUFFALDINO] Big mouth. I don’t love you anymore.

PANTALONA: You disgrace. I should give you a good slap.

BEATRICE: Yes, give her a good slap!

SMERALDINA: Oh! No-one has ever slapped me!

TRUFFALDINO: Don’t you slap her!

SMERALDINA: Oh, I love you again.

PANTALONA: Come here.

BEATRICE: You too.

Lazzo of ‘Beating in a Loop’: PANTALONA beats SMERALDINA, BEATRICE beats TRUFFALDINO, TRUFFALDINO beats PANTALONA.

PANTALONA and SMERALDINA exit.

FLORINDO enters and sees someone beating his servant.

TRUFFALDINO: No more, please!

BEATRICE: There you go, you scoundrel, that’ll teach you to open my letters!

BEATRICE exits.

SCENE SIX

TRUFFALDINO: Oh hell, poo bum and damn it! Is that how you treat a poor man like me?

FLORINDO: What are you saying?

TRUFFALDINO: I was saying to that guy, you don’t beat servants like that. It’s so rude to my master.

FLORINDO: Sì, this is an affront to me. Who is that man?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t know.

FLORINDO: Why did he hit you?

TRUFFALDINO: Beats me.

FLORINDO: Yes, but why?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t know!

FLORINDO: And you allow yourself to be beaten? You don’t move or defend yourself? Not to mention the embarrassment you caused me. Did you think of that? Donkey, layabout. If you enjoy being whipped, come here and I’ll give you a good creaming.

FLORINDO beats him with the whacking stick and then exits.

TRUFFALDINO: See, I am definitely the servant of two masters. Now to impress them with my craftiness. I have to air out their clothes.

The ZANNI enter.

Lazzo of ‘Bossing Around the Zanni’: TRUFFALDINO bosses around the ZANNI. He makes them take out the clothes to air out. The content gets mixed up.

Bring in the trunks from those rooms. Put them here. Now take out everything.

He takes out a black coat.

I want to see if there is anything in the pockets—sometimes, they have sweets.

He finds a portrait of FLORINDO.

Oh, bello! [Handsome guy!] What a lovely picture. I wonder who this belongs to? He looks familiar, actually he looks a bit like my other master.

FLORINDO: [calling from offstage] Truffaldino!

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, no. [To the ZANNI] Quick, quick, put away the stuff and close it.

FLORINDO: [offstage] Truffaldino! Do I need to get you with another beating?!

TRUFFALDINO: I’m coming.

FLORINDO enters.

FLORINDO: What the hell are you doing?

TRUFFALDINO: Caro Signor, you said to air out your clothes. I was doing my job.

FLORINDO: Did I? And the other trunk, who does it belong to?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t know nothing. Maybe some other guy?

FLORINDO: Give me my black coat.

TRUFFALDINO: Right away.

FLORINDO finds his own portrait in the coat pocket.

FLORINDO: What’s this?

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Oh, no! I’ve stuffed up.

FLORINDO: [aside] Oh, heavens, do I deceive myself? Didn’t I give this portrait of me to my dear love, Beatrice? [To TRUFFALDINO] Tell me, how did this come to be in my pocket, when it wasn’t here before?

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] How do I cover this up? Come on, think, think!

FLORINDO: Speak! Answer me. This portrait, how did it come to be in my pocket?

TRUFFALDINO: Caro Signor [Dear sir], the portrait is mine. I hid it in there so I wouldn’t lose it. I’m sorry.

FLORINDO: Where did you get this portrait?

TRUFFALDINO: Um … I inherited it from my master.

FLORINDO: Inherited?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor. I served a master—he died and left me his stuff, most of which I sold, but I kept the picture.

FLORINDO: Oh, no! How long has this master of yours been dead?

TRUFFALDINO: Um, it’s been probably a week. [Aside] I’m just saying the first thing that comes to my head.

FLORINDO: What was your master’s name?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t know, Signor, he lived in-cognito.

FLORINDO: Incognito? How long did you serve him?

TRUFFALDINO: Not long, ten, twelve days tops.

FLORINDO: [aside] Oh, heavens, I feel faint. I hope it wasn’t Beatrice—what devastation if it were her.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] He’s lapping it up, I’ll keep going.

FLORINDO: Tell me, was he young, your master?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor, young as.

FLORINDO: Without stubble?

TRUFFALDINO: Not even bum fluff.

FLORINDO: [aside] It was she for sure. Do you know where your master was from?

TRUFFALDINO: I told you he lived in-cognito.

FLORINDO: Yes, but where was he from? Turin, maybe?

TRUFFALDINO: That’s right, from Turin.

FLORINDO: [aside] Every detail is a stab to my heart. [To TRUFFALDINO] And he is definitely dead?

TRUFFALDINO: Absolutely, dead as.

FLORINDO: How did he die?

TRUFFALDINO: Um … he died in an accident, it was awful. He fell in the canal and drowned.

FLORINDO: Ah, but wait …

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Oh-oh.

FLORINDO: Are you saying … before he died, he fired you and hired another servant and that servant was the same servant who this morning asked you to collect mail from the post? Pasquale?

TRUFFALDINO: That’s right! It was Pasquale!

FLORINDO: [aside] All hope is gone. Beatrice is dead. Poor Beatrice. The heartbreak must have killed her. Oh, I cannot bear this agony.

FLORINDO exits.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, he’s sad, poor guy. Oh well, better than getting another beating. [To the ZANNI] Come on, put those trunks back before they cause more trouble!

BEATRICE and PANTALONA enter.

Oh no, here comes the other one.

BEATRICE: Believe me, Signora Pantalona, the last consignment was definitely dispatched to Venice.

PANTALONA: Maybe there was a mistake.

BEATRICE: Let’s clarify things immediately. Truffaldino!

TRUFFALDINO: Signor.

BEATRICE: Open my trunk and give me … Who does the other trunk belong to?

TRUFFALDINO: Some other guy who just arrived.

BEATRICE: Give me my diary.

TRUFFALDINO: Signor sì.

BEATRICE: Hurry up!

TRUFFALDINO hands her a book.

Who does this book belong to?

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Oh no, I’ve done it again!

BEATRICE: [aside] Letters that I wrote to Florindo? Oh my, these belong to him. I feel faint. I’m sweating, I’m shaking. I don’t where I am.

PANTALONA: What is it, Signor Federigo? Are you not well?

BEATRICE: It’s nothing. [To TRUFFALDINO] How did this book end up in my trunk?

TRUFFALDINO: Caro Signor [Dear sir], the book is mine, I hid it in there so I wouldn’t lose it. I’m sorry.

BEATRICE: How did you get this book?

TRUFFALDINO: I inherited it from my master.

BEATRICE: Inherited?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì Signor, I serve a master who died and left me his stuff, most of which I sold, but I kept this book.

BEATRICE: How long has this master of yours been dead?

TRUFFALDINO: I don’t know, ten or twelve days?

BEATRICE: [aside] Oh, wretched me. [To TRUFFALDINO] This master of yours, was his name Florindo?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì! Florindo.

BEATRICE: Aretusi?

TRUFFALDINO: Correct, Aresushi.

BEATRICE: And you’re certain he’s dead.

TRUFFALDINO: Absolutely, dead as. Dead as a sewer rat squashed between two gondolas.

BEATRICE: And how did he die?

TRUFFALDINO: It was awful, he died in an accident. He fell in the canal and drowned, and we never saw him again.

BEATRICE: Oh, inconsolable me! Florindo my love is dead and dead is all my hope. What’s the point of living if the only person I’ve lived for is gone? Everything was in vain. All caution thrown to the wind. The plan to reunite with my love—unhappy ending. I leave my country, abandon my family, face danger, risk my life and dress as a man, all for Florindo. And now my Florindo is dead. Was the loss of my brother not enough that I need to lose my love as well? But what if I was the cause of their deaths, what if heaven has a vendetta against me? Tears are useless and so is lamenting. Florindo is gone. Oh, how the pain oppresses me. I can no longer see the light. My idol, my betrothed, I will follow you in despair.

BEATRICE exits.

PANTALONA: A woman?

TRUFFALDINO: A woman!

PANTALONA: Che bello! [How wonderful!] I’m going to tell my daughter.

PANTALONA exits.

TRUFFALDINO: Wow, can you believe that?! I’m not the servant of two masters, but the servant of one master and one mistress! Who would have thought? Hang on a minute, I’ve been duped! That’s not very nice.

TRUFFALDINO exits.

SCENE SEVEN

Outside in the street. DOTTORE.

DOTTORE: I cannot fathom that old coot Pantalona. The more I think about it, the more my bile boils.

PANTALONA enters.

PANTALONA: Dottore, la riverisco [I revere thee].

DOTTORE: I am astounded that you have the gall to greet me.

PANTALONA: I’ve got news.

DOTTORE: I suppose you want to tell me that you have celebrated the wedding. Well, I don’t give a flying fig.

PANTALONA: No, that’s not it, let me speak …

DOTTORE: Speak and curse you that you may be plagued with a flesh-eating cancer.

PANTALONA: [aside] If only I could punch him in the face. [To DOTTORE] My daughter, if you want, will be Silvio’s.

DOTTORE: Much obliged, but don’t bother. My son won’t digest this. Give her to the man from Turin.

PANTALONA: When you know whom the man from Turin is you will change your tune.

DOTTORE: He could be the queen of England. Your daughter is second-hand goods. Et hoc sufficit. [And that’s enough (in Latin).]

DOTTORE exits.

SILVIO enters.

PANTALONA: Che bestia! [What a beast!] [Seeing SILVIO] Oh, here comes that peacock son of his. In Goldoni’s Venetian text he used the word ‘spuzzetta’, which is a bit like saying ‘shithead’. But we don’t say ‘shithead’ because that’s offensive. So don’t say ‘shithead’, okay?

Lazzo of ‘Don’t Say the Word’ (as in previous scenes).

SILVIO: [aside] There she is—I’m tempted to stab her in the heart.

PANTALONA: Signor Silvio, put your sword down, I have good news.

SILVIO: So speak.

PANTALONA: The wedding between my daughter and Federigo has gone up shit creek.

SILVIO: Without a paddle?

PANTALONA: Without a paddle.

SILVIO: Is this true?

PANTALONA: It’s true, so you can still have her if you want.

SILVIO: Oh, heavens! You have resurrected me from the dead. Wait, how can I hold close to my breast a woman who has been betrothed to another?

PANTALONA: In short, Federigo Rasponi is his sister, Beatrice.

SILVIO: I don’t understand?

PANTALONA: [aside] He’s as thick as a log. [To SILVIO] Federigo is Beatrice.

SILVIO: Dressed as a man?

PANTALONA: Sì.

SILVIO: Oh, now I understand.

PANTALONA: About bloody time.

SILVIO: Oh no, Clarice hasn’t been unfaithful. Oh, heaven forgive me, what have I done? What have I said to her? I was driven by my passion …

PANTALONA: Save it, Romeo. Let’s find Clarice.

PANTALONA and SILVIO exit.

SCENE EIGHT

A room in Brighella’s Inn. BRIGHELLA.

BEATRICE and FLORINDO enter, separately, with swords.

FLORINDO: Life is not worth living anymore.

BEATRICE: Goodbye, cruel world.

BRIGHELLA: Don’t get blood on the carpet.

BEATRICE and FLORINDO turn to look at BRIGHELLA and they see each other.

FLORINDO: Beatrice?

BEATRICE: Florindo? You’re …

FLORINDO: Alive.

BEATRICE: My love!

FLORINDO: My soul!

FLORINDO and BEATRICE drop their swords and embrace.

What led you to take such drastic—?

BEATRICE: The false news of—

FLORINDO: —my death? I too was led to believe that you—

BEATRICE: —were dead. Who made you believe—?

FLORINDO: My servant.

BEATRICE: Mine too. And this book was the reason I believed him.

FLORINDO: How did you end up with …? Ah, it would have come to you just as this portrait came to me.

BEATRICE: Those sly servants of ours, they deserve a really good beating.

FLORINDO: Oh, how I’ve missed you.

BEATRICE: Let’s cause them some suffering.

FLORINDO: One thousand fibs my servant told me about you.

BEATRICE: Likewise about you …

FLORINDO: And where are they now?

BEATRICE: Let’s find them and beat them.

FLORINDO: Brighella? Find our servants.

BRIGHELLA: Sì Signori. [Yes sirs.]

BEATRICE: Yes, bring them here and the whacking stick too.

FLORINDO: You too are lodged here?

BEATRICE: I am, yet we never crossed paths. Destiny wanted to torment us.

FLORINDO: Tell me, Federigo—

BEATRICE: Died on impact.

FLORINDO: [aside] I knew it. [To BEATRICE] I’m sorry for your loss, my love.

BEATRICE: No need to apologise, he was a prick.

FLORINDO: What will they say in Turin of your departure?

BEATRICE: If you return as my husband, all gossip will end.

FLORINDO: But if I’m charged with the death of—

BEATRICE: The money I have acquired from Pantalona will free you from this predicament. And they all thought he was a prick too. These servants, where are they?

FLORINDO: Ah, here’s one now.

TRUFFALDINO enters.

Come, come, there’s no need to be afraid.

BEATRICE: We won’t hurt you.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] Sure.

FLORINDO: Come now, we know you and the other rascal are in cahoots.

TRUFFALDINO: [to BEATRICE] Excuse us. I will tell you everything in a moment. [To FLORINDO] You know, master, that out of all these events I am not at fault, it was all Pasquale, the servant of that lady over there. He’s the one that mixed up all the stuff. The junk from your trunk went into hers and her junk went into yours. The poor guy told me to keep my mouth shut so his master wouldn’t fire him. And me, being so good-hearted that I would give my left nut to help a friend, made up all these stories to fix the mess. And that’s the story, told to you by the sincere, honest and faithful servant that I am.

TRUFFALDINO bows.

BEATRICE: [aside] What are they talking about?

FLORINDO: [to TRUFFALDINO] So this Pasquale was Signora Beatrice’s servant?

TRUFFALDINO: [to FLORINDO] Sì. It was Pasquale.

FLORINDO: You knew my urgency in wanting to find him, why the hell did you keep it a secret?

TRUFFALDINO: Pasquale begged me.

FLORINDO: And why not obey your master?

TRUFFALDINO: For the love of Pasquale.

BEATRICE: Uffa! [Ugh!]

FLORINDO: Sorry, my love, he’s telling me—

TRUFFALDINO: Shush please, tell her it was me and that she can give me a good thrashing if she wants. But not to hurt Pasquale.

FLORINDO: I think she’d enjoy that. You are very amorous towards this Pasquale.

TRUFFALDINO: I love him.

BEATRICE: Well?

TRUFFALDINO: [to FLORINDO] Excuse me. I’ll be back in a moment. [To BEATRICE] Did you know he had a servant called Pasquale who is the biggest simpleton in the world? It was him who mixed up your stuff. And because the poor guy was scared that he would get fired, I made up the story about the book and the drowned master. And I just told Signor Florindo that I was to blame for everything.

FLORINDO: This is going on too long. [To TRUFFALDINO] Basta. [Enough.] [To BEATRICE] Signora Beatrice, our servants didn’t do this with malice, and since things have worked out for us, we can forgive them.

BEATRICE: So no beating? 

FLORINDO: Maybe later.

BEATRICE: Fine. Now, I need to go to Signora Pantalona’s. [To FLORINDO] Would you join me there?

FLORINDO: Of course, my love. 

TRUFFALDINO: [to BEATRICE] Excuse us a moment. 

BEATRICE: What now!

TRUFFALDINO: [to FLORINDO] Signor, I’d like to ask you a favour.

FLORINDO: What do you want?

TRUFFALDINO: I too, poor man that I am, am in love. 

FLORINDO: Are you in love?

TRUFFALDINO: Signor, sì. And my girlfriend is the mistress of Signora Pantalona. And I’d like you—

FLORINDO: What have I got to do with it?

TRUFFALDINO: Well, seeing as I’m your servant, maybe you can put a good word in for me to Signora Pantalona?

FLORINDO: Well, first we need to see if the girl wants you?

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, she definitely wants me. 

FLORINDO: Fine. I just need to wash my hair first. 

FLORINDO exits.

BEATRICE: Truffaldino, let’s go!

TRUFFALDINO: [to BEATRICE] Do you mind if I stay and serve this signor, seeing as Pasquale isn’t here?

BEATRICE: Yes, good idea, and you will show him the way to Signora Pantalona’s.

BEATRICE exits.

TRUFFALDINO exits.

SCENE NINE

A room in Pantalona’s house.

SILVIO, DOTTORE and PANTALONA are trying to make amends with CLARICE. SMERALDINA watches.

PANTALONA: Come now, Clarice. Signor Silvio is sorry and begs for your forgiveness. He did it for love. I have forgiven him and so should you.

SILVIO: My pain was just as deep as yours, Signora Clarice. And furthermore, henceforth, I really love you. The fear of losing you drove me to blind fury. The heavens want us to be happy. Don’t let your anger and desire for revenge ruin us forever.

DOTTORE: My dear daughter-in-law, sympathise with him. He was on the verge of madness.

CLARICE is encouraged by SMERALDINA to stay silent.

SILVIO: Cara [Dear] Clarice, is it possible that your lips utter no words? I know I deserve your reproaches, but for pity sake, punish me with your words, not with your silence. Here I am, at your feet. Have mercy on me.

CLARICE continues to ignore him.

If I were to believe that you would want my blood to seek revenge for my cruelty, I will show you now with pleasure. But instead of the blood from my veins, which would really hurt, take that which pours from my eyes.

SILVIO cries.

DOTTORE: Bravo. [Good boy.]

CLARICE: Oh, Silvio …

SMERALDINA shakes her head.

… cruel Silvio.

SMERALDINA nods in approval.

SILVIO: Please, Signora Clarice, have pity.

CLARICE: I will …

SMERALDINA shakes her head.

… not!

SILVIO: Cara, my dear … I beg your forgiveness for my cruelty.

SMERALDINA gestures ‘and’.

CLARICE: And …

SILVIO: Stupidity …

SMERALDINA gestures ‘and’.

CLARICE: And …

SMERALDINA mimes something to CLARICE.

And for your misogynistic and unwarranted sexist rant about women?

SMERALDINA gives her the thumbs up.

SILVIO: And for that too. Forgive me.

CLARICE: I have forgiven you.

SMERALDINA: [aside] That makes one of us.

SILVIO: Ti amo! [I love you!]

CLARICE: Amore mio. [My love.] I love you too. [To SMERALDINA] Can I kiss him?

SMERALDINA: Of course. [Aside] That’s the best bit!

PANTALONA: Viva gli sposi! [Long live the bride and groom!]

DOTTORE: And now my work here is done. I shall go and draw up the paperwork immediately.

DOTTORE exits.

BEATRICE enters.

BEATRICE: With your good graces, permission to enter.

PANTALONA: Signora Beatrice! Where is Brighella, I’ve got a bone to pick with him. He misled me! He assured me that Federigo was in fact Federigo. But he wasn’t! Federigo was you!

BEATRICE: Dear Signora Pantalona, please do not be angry with Brighella. Who wouldn’t have been tricked? Federigo and I were siblings, twins, two halves of an apple. With these clothes, Brighella couldn’t have doubted it was Federigo.

PANTALONA: Fine. It’s over. Now what do you want?

BEATRICE: Signora Pantalona, Signori, I am here to ask for your forgiveness, if for fault of my own I have inconvenienced you.

CLARICE: Think nothing of it.

She embraces her.

SILVIO: Err.

BEATRICE: What, she can’t even hug a woman?

SILVIO: Those clothes still give me the heebie-jeebies.

PANTALONA: Fine. You are forgiven. And your boyfriend?

BEATRICE: Yes, thank heavens, Florindo is alive.

PANTALONA: That’s great.

A knock is heard.

Smeraldina, see who that is.

SMERALDINA: [shouting] Come in!

TRUFFALDINO enters.

TRUFFALDINO: Your humble and reverent servant at your service for all you good signori [sirs and madams]. Signor Florindo is here and wants permission to enter.

PANTALONA: Permission granted.

TRUFFALDINO: [shouting] Come in! [To SMERALDINA.] Ciao, bella. [Hello, beautiful.]

SMERALDINA: Ciao, bello. [Hello, handsome.]

FLORINDO enters.

FLORINDO: Your humble servant. [To PANTALONA] Are you the master of the house?

SILVIO: Sì, I am the master … but not of this house.

PANTALONA: I am.

FLORINDO: La riverisco. [I revere you.]

PANTALONA: Riverita. [I am revered.]

SMERALDINA: [to CLARICE] Cara Signora [Dear Madam], I would like to ask you a favour.

CLARICE: What do you want?

SMERALDINA: [to CLARICE] I too am a very pretty young single lady who’d like to marry. The servant of Signora Beatrice is interested. Could you give your consent?

CLARICE: Sì, Smeraldina, I’ll do it gladly.

SILVIO: Signor, do you recognise me?

FLORINDO: Yes, you are the savage who challenged Beatrice to a duel.

SILVIO: Yes, it was poor form. Forgive me. Fortunately she disarmed me and saved my life.

BEATRICE: You can say that again.

SILVIO: Fortunately she disarmed me and saved my life.

CLARICE: But only because I intervened.

SILVIO: Even more true.

FLORINDO: [to PANTALONA] Signora Beatrice and I intend to marry and we would like you to honour us as a witness to this wedding.

PANTALONA: I am honoured. Join your hands.

FLORINDO: I’m ready, Signora Beatrice.

BEATRICE: Here is my hand, Signor Florindo.

TRUFFALDINO: [aside] They don’t waste any time.

CLARICE: Friend, I am happy for you.

BEATRICE: And I for … thank you.

PANTALONA: Are we ready?

TRUFFALDINO: I object! Not really, I just have to … [To FLORINDO] Can I have a word?

FLORINDO: Right now? What do you want?

TRUFFALDINO: Do you remember what you promised me?

FLORINDO: What?

TRUFFALDINO: To ask Signora Pantalona for Smeraldina’s hand.

FLORINDO: Yes, I remember. Fine. I’ll do it immediately. [To PANTALONA] Signora Pantalona, even though this is the first time I’ve had the honour of meeting you, I feel bold enough to ask another favour.

PANTALONA: Shoot.

FLORINDO: My servant longs to have your servant as a wife. Would you have any problem in handing them over?

SMERALDINA: [aside] Oh, bella! [Great!] Another one wants me! I wonder who this other guy is?

PANTALONA: I’m happy. [To SMERALDINA] What do you say?

SMERALDINA: I say why not?

CLARICE: Signor Florindo has beaten me to it. I was to ask for Smeraldina’s hand for the servant of Signora Beatrice. But you have already asked for yours, so don’t worry about it.

FLORINDO: No, no, but if you made this promise to your servant, I will step aside and allow Beatrice’s servant the honour of yours.

BEATRICE: I don’t mind, Signor Florindo, so you go ahead.

FLORINDO: You are being too polite. Signora Beatrice my love, ignore my request. In fact, I forbid him to marry.

TRUFFALDINO: Oh!

BEATRICE: And to be fair I shall forbid mine to marry too.

SMERALDINA: Oh!

TRUFFALDINO: Oh, great! They act all nice and I stay single!

SMERALDINA: Mamma mia! [My goodness!] From having two husbands, I’ll end up with none!

PANTALONA: Come on, just give her one or the other.

FLORINDO: To mine no, I refuse to challenge my little snookums.

BEATRICE: Nor I permit myself to do this to my little hot salami.

TRUFFALDINO: Excuse me. I’ll fix this. [To FLORINDO] Did you not ask for Smeraldina’s hand in marriage for your servant?

FLORINDO: Sì.

TRUFFALDINO: [to CLARICE] And you, did you not intend Smeraldina for the servant of Signora Beatrice?

CLARICE: Sì.

TRUFFALDINO: Right. So, Smeraldina, give me your hand.

PANTALONA: Why?

TRUFFALDINO: Because I, I am the servant of Signor Florindo and of Signora Beatrice!

All react.

FLORINDO: Signora Beatrice, your servant, where is he?

BEATRICE: Here he is.

FLORINDO: Truffaldino is my servant.

BEATRICE: Isn’t yours Pasquale?

FLORINDO: Wasn’t Pasquale yours?

BEATRICE: What’s going on?

TRUFFALDINO shrugs and makes apologetic gestures.

FLORINDO: You served two masters at the same time?

TRUFFALDINO: Sì, Signori. Look, it’s a funny story, you’ll laugh when I tell you. I done a clever thing, you have to admit. It didn’t last long but at least I can be proud that no-one found out until now. In truth, if it wasn’t for the love of that girl I may have even got away with it, but her damn beauty and brains just got me. But seeing as you’re all in love and happy and stuff, maybe all you good sirs will find it in your hearts to forgive me. Scusa! E viva l’amore! [Sorry! And long live love!]

ALL: Long live love!

THE END
