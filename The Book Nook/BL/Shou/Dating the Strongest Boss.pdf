Dating The Strongest Boss

Arc 0
 “Hey, look! That ugly monster is so dirty!”

“Tut-tut, how does he still have the face to come to school? If it were me, I would have long hidden at home!”

“Hiding at home? With his prostitute mother?”

There was another burst of laughter. 

The boy had black-framed glasses and thick bangs. His head was lowered, with something sticky like egg white clinging stiffly to his hair. His entire being was cowering as he wore his school uniform, which was also messy. In fact, all the clothes on his body were soaked and muddy. 

Everyone around him only had to take one glance before voluntarily moving to the side, holding their breath as they thought they smelled a strange odor from the boy. Their hurtful remarks weren’t concealed from the boy. They were filled with malicious intent, hoping to see him die on the spot. 

At this age, children were supposed to be the most innocent, but who would have thought that it was the words of these people that were the most vicious?

Xu Sheng’s gaze was always lowered, and his bangs blocked his eyes. So, no one would have guessed that this person who covered his eyes all year round would have a pair of captivating pupils, completely grey like a pool of water. 

Xu Sheng tightened his fists.

It would be good if they all died!

Xiao Chen looked out the window, his beautiful face involuntarily frowning when he noticed the teenagers downstairs. 

The girl in front of him followed his gaze, and when she saw clearly what was going on, she couldn’t help but laugh mockingly. “Senior, do you also know him?”

“What?”

“It’s Xu Sheng, of course! I’ve heard that his mother is a prostitute.” The girl would score a ten out of ten for her sweet and crisp voice, but she didn’t know how unpleasant her words were.

Xiao Chen withdrew his gaze, his expression cold as he said, “Don’t say that about others!”

The girl froze. This was the first time she saw Senior’s indifferent appearance. In her memory, Senior was always gentle, and had a smile on his face. He was patient with everyone, so the girl’s eyes reddened as she murmured, “Yes, sorry.” 

Xiao Chen sighed and said seriously, “Don’t talk about others like that in the future!”

The girl nodded her head, biting her lip in shame and holding back her tears as she turned around and left the classroom. 

Xiao Chen ignored her and peered downstairs. 

The boy from before was already gone.

Xiao Chen’s thoughts scattered for some reason. He felt that his current self and his past self had become two people. Everything started a few days ago, when he wasn’t able to adjust to the way his past self lived.

In the eyes of all his classmates, Xiao Chen was a gentle person, but only he himself knew the hypocrisy that lay beneath the surface. 

All of his kindness and friendliness merely benefited himself, while his true character was actually selfish and unfeeling. He just decorated himself with a tender facade.

If it was the past Xiao Chen who saw the scene downstairs, he might not have had to pretend to be unaware, and he would directly take the boy’s side. 

But the present Xiao Chen’s heart couldn’t be moved by this demonstration of bullying on the campus. 

“What, b*tch, you want to eat?” The yellow-haired boy blocked Xu Sheng’s way, and several other boys with colorful hair surrounded him. 

Xu Sheng silently lowered his head, carrying his food in his hands. He had specifically picked a time with few people and had walked close to the wall to reduce his presence. But he knew that as long as he was on the campus, there would definitely be all sorts of probing eyes. Most of them were curious or disgusted. Even when he went to the bathroom, he would be locked in the stall. When he went to eat, there would be a lot of people bothering him. So, he should be used to it. 

Yellow Hair had been a bully since his first year in high school, and from his perspective, Xu Sheng would always appear like someone who had lost his own parents.

Initially, he had no reason to bully Xu Sheng, and even if he was muddle-headed, he wouldn’t randomly build enmity with someone. But last month, he was reported when he beat up a boy in the small forest behind the school, where there were no security cameras or other people!

However, he distinctly remembered that Xu Sheng had passed nearby, so he immediately went to find trouble with him, refusing to listen to any explanation. 

Xu Sheng was originally someone who didn’t speak much, so he wouldn’t take the initiative to defend himself. He knew the more fiercely he resisted, the more excited his attackers would be. All he could do was protect his head.

Yellow Hair sneered, violently shoving Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng’s balance was off and he staggered back two steps, but he held onto his bowl without letting the food fall, as if it would decide his life or death. 

The people around the two couldn’t help but look over like they were watching a good show. They murmured as they discussed, and there was even a variety of gloating laughter. All of their loathing was directed towards the weak and lonely person in front of them. Yellow Hair enjoyed this attention. 

“Yo! Alright! You want to eat? Believe me or not……..” His voice hadn’t faded yet before a figure squeezed through the crowd and entered the enclosure.

“What are you doing?! Fighting is not allowed on campus!” Xiao Chen hardened his expression and held out his hand to stop Yellow Hair from going any further.

The surroundings were instantly as quiet as a chicken.

Few people here did not recognize Xiao Chen, and even Yellow Hair knew him. Xiao Chen’s face was just too flawless, and he would dazzle others when he walked by them. He was the chairman of the second year student union, and also the top student in his year. Within the entire school, at least 80% of the girls were his fans, and even 50% of the boys were bewitched by Xiao Chen’s face. Surprisingly, Yellow Hair was part of that 50%.

Xu Sheng’s head was still lowered, behaving like he had seen a stranger. But the grey eyes beneath his bangs widened slightly, and the hands tightly clasping the bowl shook.

How could there be someone willing to help him…

Xiao Chen’s eyes widened. He faced Yellow Hair, his pure eyes reflecting the other’s figure, and said, “In the future, don’t bully other students!”

Yellow Hair stared at Xiao Chen and gritted his teeth. The crowd around them was unable to believe what they were seeing. Yellow Hair could only avert his gaze and reluctantly say, “You’re lucky this time!”

Yellow Hair looked back at Xiao Chen and Xu Sheng every three steps as he led his group of brothers to slowly leave.

Xiao Chen’s eyes raked through the students who had observed the confrontation. Everyone lowered their heads when Xiao Chen looked over, wishing they were invisible and reducing their own presence. Each tore off their previous attitude of scorn. 

Xiao Chen calmed down and returned to his cold face. He turned around and inspected the bullied, timid boy, feeling a little distressed. There was something on the boy’s hair, making his looks fit his position as a punching bag for the bullies. 

But somehow, Xiao Chen felt intimate with the boy when he saw him. Even as a person who loved cleanliness, he didn’t detest the boy because of his sorry appearance. 

When Xiao Chen extended his hand, the boy suddenly raised his head and awkwardly stared at the hand in front of him. It was also at this moment that Xiao Chen finally saw the boy’s face clearly. 

Along with very white skin, he had high cheekbones, a straight nose, and big eyes which reflected Xiao Chen’s outline. His face was comparable to a celebrity’s. 

Xu Sheng was taken aback, with shock written across his face. As if he had seen Wen Shen, he ran away with all his might, leaving Xiao Chen standing alone. 

No, he can’t get used to this kind of gentleness, this kind of gentleness is addictive!

After a long time, Xu Sheng’s footsteps stopped in front of the campus bulletin board. On it, there was a list of the most outstanding students of each grade. In the column for the second year students, first place was Xiao Chen. In the photo, the corners of the boy’s mouth were slightly raised, and his eyes were curved into crescents. Even if it was a one-inch photo, it captured a fresh aura.

Xu Sheng’s right hand couldn’t help touching the photo, handling it cautiously as if it were a precious treasure. His eyes held an obsessive love, like a dying man who had found salvation at the brink of death. This was his god and his light.

Xiao Chen.

He spoke softly.

And for the rest of his life, these two words would be deeply imprinted in his entire existence.

Do you know? If you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.



 <I like you, your eyebrows, your lips, everything about you, I only like you! You are my salvation!>

Xiao Chen picked up the card on the table and frowned. He quickly looked around himself, but there were only a few other students in the classroom. He could be counted as one of the earliest people to come to school every day and one of the latest to leave. It had already been two weeks since he had been able to receive similar cards to the one currently in his hand. There would always be some things stuffed into his desk, such as thermoses, snacks, and breakfast. 

And today there was an umbrella inside. 

Xiao Chen was stunned. He was a person who didn’t like to bring an umbrella, so if it didn’t rain too hard, he wouldn’t take one unless he absolutely needed to. In addition, he didn’t pay much attention to the weather forecast. Most of the time, as long as it rained, he would be drenched like a chicken which had fallen into soup. But he could never remember to bring an umbrella.

Yesterday when school ended, it suddenly began to drizzle, and Xiao Chen had to use his school uniform to cover himself. His house wasn’t far away from the school, and it only took 10 minutes to walk there. By the time he arrived back home, he was already soaked.

Xiao Chen patted the male student closest to him and asked, “Who was the one who came first today?”

The male student froze for two seconds. “It was me, what’s the matter?”

Xiao Chen held up the umbrella. “Do you know who put this in my desk?”

The male student shook his head. “I didn’t pay attention, but I haven’t left the classroom since I entered. It must have been placed inside your desk before I arrived.”

Xiao Chen nodded in reply and didn’t speak as he returned to his seat and looked out the window. 

His seat was by the window and had a very wide view.

His sight flickered, abruptly meeting light grey eyes outside. 

It was that boy.

He paused.

Xu Sheng was hiding behind the bulletin board, shyly sticking out half of his face. His thick bangs fell to the side as he tilted his head, revealing a pair of eyes. They locked onto Xiao Chen’s window in the distance. When Xiao Chen looked over, the boy tried to hide by crouching on the ground and shrinking into a ball, but his actions only made himself more obvious. One of his eyes cautiously peeked out, staring fixedly at Xiao Chen like a mimosa pudica flower that had closed its leaves bashfully after being poked by someone. But this flower remained stubborn and carefully wrapped its leaves around the person’s finger, refusing to let go.

Without knowing why he had these feelings, the corners of Xiao Chen’s mouth lifted into an amused smile. 

Xu Sheng’s figure shrank even lower.

He saw me! He even smiled at me!

The boy swallowed, his eyes scorching and crazy as he showed a silly smile. 

Ah, my Senior;

The rain came as expected and pitter-pattered on the asphalt pavement. Students grouped together in twos or threes and held umbrellas as they walked towards the school’s entrance, happily laughing and bustling about. 

“Sister Ni, we don’t have an umbrella. What should we do?” A long-haired girl wore a miniskirt and Dr. Martens boots, constantly tapping her foot on the floor. She looked at the rain in front of her and was somewhat annoyed. Then, she glanced at the short-haired girl beside her, who had a hairstyle similar to a boy’s. 

The tomboy’s name was Li Ni, while the long-haired girl’s name was Zhou Qingqing. 

Li Ni snorted and coldly laughed. She used a finger to casually point at a corner. “Don’t we have him?”

Zhou Qingqing frowned. “Him?”

She only saw the boy squatting alone in the corner, seeming sneaky, with no one knowing what kind of things he was doing. His thick bangs blocked his eyes, and he tightly grasped an umbrella in his hand. No one knew how long he had stood there for. 

Wasn’t this boy Xu Sheng?

“No way, if we take his umbrella, we might get AIDS! With how dirty his mother is, he definitely got a disease from her! What should we do when we get sick?” Zhou Qingqing’s voice wasn’t that loud, but it could be clearly heard within ten meters. Hearing this, people around the two looked sideways, their gaze filled with disgust and maliciousness towards Xu Sheng. No one cared that the girls’ original purpose was to steal someone else’s stuff. 

But Xu Sheng didn’t even bother to listen, so he didn’t refute them. 

Xiao Chen frowned. He had just walked down the stairs when he heard the two girls, giving him chills. AIDS couldn’t be transmitted through body contact, but more importantly, how could these children in the flower of their youth use such insidious words to judge someone! Even with Xiao Chen’s good temperament, he couldn’t help but want to swear. 

Xiao Chen handed his own umbrella to one of the girls. Zhou Qingqing was originally distracted, but once she saw who it was, her cheeks were tinged red. She whispered, “Senior, Senior Xiao Chen?” 

In the beginning, Xu Sheng wanted to be regarded as a corpse, but now he started to tremble. He secretly lifted his head, narrowing his eyes into a thin line. He gripped the umbrella in his hand silently, his eyes burning and filled with killing intent. 

The good looking boy passed his umbrella to the shy, love-struck girl in front of him. 

How could Senior give away the umbrella Xu Sheng gifted him! Why should he be so good to others! What qualifications does this woman have to receive Senior’s care?

Xu Sheng clenched his teeth, and his twisted universe seemed to explode.

In that case…

they should all go die! Senior is only his!

Go die! All of you go die!! Every single one of you guys!

Xiao Chen showed a slightly ironic smile. “Junior classmate, listen to your senior’s advice and be more polite. If a girl as young as you can speak so viciously, you must also be very bitter!” He lifted his legs and approached Zhou Qingqing, who was absentminded as she murmured, “What?”

“Otherwise, how could you be so unwilling to see others happy?” Xiao Chen’s tone wasn’t harsh, so it seemed rather gentle, with words like pearl beads. This sentence wasn’t cruel when compared to what the girl had said. The girl’s face reddened, and the people nearby were unable to speak. 

Senior…

Xu Sheng’s eyes widened, his expression grim until he looked closer and became distinctly ecstatic. His heart beat rapidly, and he felt like he would faint in the next second. He clearly wasn’t someone who had heart disease, but he felt like he couldn’t breathe anymore. His senses were so strong that they couldn’t be neglected. 

He intensely focused on the back of his Senior, enduring even when his eyes were so dry they hurt, as if he was afraid that the other would disappear.

This is his salvation…….

Xu Sheng’s mouth drew into a casual arc. 

His god……

His Senior……

The news that Xiao Chen had helped Xu Sheng had spread all over the campus earlier. After all, with the addition of Yellow Hair, the three were very famous in the school. At first, Zhou Qingqing and other girls still didn’t believe it, but they saw it today! She bit her lip grievingly and whispered, “But I didn’t say anything wrong…….”

Xiao Chen smiled, and icily said, “Junior classmate, don’t say any more. Take this umbrella and go home early, don’t stand in the rain.” He peered at the awkward Li Ni who was standing next to Zhou Qingqing, and said, “I think you two shouldn’t be like this in the future!” His tone was light, but it also brought a sense of dominance. He left the other party with a path to escape so that they wouldn’t look too bad.

Observing the back view of the two girls in the distance, the crowd intentionally or unintentionally immediately dispersed. 

But no one noticed that the heads of the two girls were shrouded in a cloud of black mist, and that a somber air of death wrapped around their limbs. There was even a bit of blood. 

The small discussions reached Xiao Chen’s ear. 

“Why does Senior treat that weirdo so good?”

“It’s not that, Senior is just a considerate person. He treats everyone very well!”

“……”

Xiao Chen withdrew his gaze and lightly, step-by-step neared the boy’s position.

Xu Sheng froze in place. At this moment, his five senses amplified until he could even hear the clear and incomparable sound of every step on the ground. All things in the world seemed to lose color, with only Xiao Chen’s bright light remaining. 

Xiao Chen squatted to be at the same height as the boy, and smiled. “Classmate, are you okay?”

Xu Sheng’s mind wandered, his mouth slightly agape as if he had been scared silly. 

Xiao Chen wasn’t upset. Once he saw that Xu Sheng wasn’t hurt, he said, “It’s good if you’re fine. It’s not that early anymore. You should also go home. I’m leaving!”

Xu Sheng heard the word “go” and violently raised his head. Xiao Chen was stunned. The boy’s light grey eyes were inconceivably beautiful, and hidden behind his bangs was an androgynous face, with fair skin. Without waiting for Xiao Chen to recover from the impact of his shock, the boy hurriedly stuffed something into his arms and rose up to run back to the teaching building, leaving a trail of dust in his wake.

Xiao Chen bowed his head.

It was an umbrella.

A pair of eyes looked through the glass window and scanned the crowd. 

Xiao Chen opened the umbrella and slowly left. 

Xu Sheng hastily followed, his sight, all hot and crazy, locking onto the other. 



 Something’s not right.

Xiao Chen had this kind of unusual feeling as soon as he entered the classroom. Almost everyone was huddled in twos and threes, chatting about a mysterious topic. Their voices weren’t loud, like they were whispering. And the instant he stepped inside, a weird silence fell over all of them. What made him more confused was that everyone’s eyes were on him. Xiao Chen was dumbfounded, but he walked into the classroom pretending he didn’t notice anything. But the stares directed at him didn’t lessen at all, continuing to brazenly stick to him. 

These kinds of stares were blatant, and even contained a bit of ridicule. 

This made Xiao Chen extremely uncomfortable, like there was something that everyone knew about him, but only he himself was hidden in the drum. 

Finally, after this eerie atmosphere lasted for a whole two minutes, Xiao Chen patted a boy next to him and asked, “Why are you guys looking at me like that?”

The boy appeared like he had seen a ghost. “You don’t know?”

“Wait, what don’t I know?” Xiao Chen frowned. “What should I have known earlier?”

A girl at the side, who had been watching the drama, moved closer. “Xiao Chen, you didn’t read the school’s Tieba today?” The girl threw an ambiguous smile at Xiao Chen.

“?”

The boy from earlier looked around and shouted to the classmates next to him, “You guys check outside the classroom for the teacher, I’ll show Xiao Chen the school’s Tieba!”

“Okay~” In the surroundings, a chorus of voices came one after another. They weren’t loud and they dragged on, but they all made Xiao Chen sense their bad intentions.

The boy pulled out his phone from his backpack, excitedly entering Tieba and clicking on the homepage of the school’s Tieba. “See for yourself.”

Xiao Chen took the phone apprehensively. 

The moment Tieba was opened, there was a post pinned by the owner called ‘Take a peak, that perverted man whose mother is a pros/titute likes Senior Xiao Chen!’.

Xiao Chen’s eyelids leaped, and he inexplicably felt suffocated.

[I assume there is no one in the school who hasn’t heard of Senior Xiao Chen, right? But for Xu Sheng, this perverted man, let me explain! 

This topic creator (TC) and that perverted man are classmates, but I won’t tell you guys who I am. But that isn’t important! The important thing is that perverted man. 

TC is aware that the relationship between the perverted man and Senior Xiao Chen was formed when the latter kindly lent him a hand a few days ago. After all, such an excellent, gentle, and honest person would even help a small cat or dog on the road, right?

It is this well-known fact that made the perverted man have presumptuous thoughts!

The perverted man has bad grades and doesn’t listen in class, but recently I discovered that he was writing something in his notebook, just like a good student! This move immediately aroused TC’s curiosity, and finding a chance when he was in the bathroom, I secretly opened his notebook!

Holy cow, if I didn’t read it I wouldn’t have known, but I was so frightened I jumped!

There were three whole books that were densely packed! And there were only two words in total, you heard it correctly! I trust you guys have already guessed what they were!

Xiao Chen.

If you guys still don’t believe me, please see my photo! {photo}{photo}

Not only that! He also drew portraits of Xiao Chen! {photo}

Of course! The amazing revelations don’t stop here! This pervert is also an idiot!

He recorded when Senior came to school every day! What he ate every day! Who he talked to every day! Where he lives! What bookstore he will go to after school! Wait for a whole series of details, he’s simply a peeping tom!! 

My God, if I was Senior, I would strangle him to death!! He follows Senior every day!! {photo}{photo}]

First comment: After reading, holy cow, is this person sick?

Second comment: My goodness! Senior Xiao Chen is too miserable, being peeped at and followed every day by the pervert, oh my god, this pervert simply doesn’t have any face! 

Third comment: Alas! It’s actually homosexuality??

Fourth comment: Previous comment! How has homosexuality offended you? Are we discussing homosexuality right now? Isn’t our goal to fight against the pervert? Homosexuals are not guilty!

……

Thirty-second comment: If I have to say something, Xu Sheng will probably be beaten to death! The entire school likes Xiao Chen, tut-tut! I have heard that a third year sister is already planning to call people to teach him a lesson!

Thirty-third comment: Previous comment, more than that! I have heard that the people in their class are already planning to surround him in the bathroom and teach him a lesson!

……

One hundred and fifty-first comment: {link} Quickly, everyone look! The pervert was taught a lesson in the bathroom! Hahaha!

Xiao Chen speedily turned page after page, his breathing becoming rapid. Almost without exception, all of the comments were fighting against Xu Sheng! 

When he saw the one hundred and fifty-first comment, his pupils contracted. He shakingly reached to click on the link, his heart suddenly stopping, and feeling as if he couldn’t breathe. 

“Hey.” The girl next to Xiao Chen had been observing his reaction, and once she confirmed the contents of the link, she turned malicious.

“What? What happened?” The people around them noticed the girl behave in this way, so they all craned their necks to have a peek. But when they all saw clearly, they stepped back and carried the same hostility.

“My god, this is simply burning my eyes, frick me!” 

“This man is too disgusting.”

The link brought them to a new website with only photos inside. Before the video even played, delicate white skin could be seen. The background was a dimly lit bathroom, and the entire video was blurry, with the main parts under a mosaic. The boy was curled into a corner, close to his messy clothes on the ground. He was clutching his head firmly, only revealing his chin and not his face. But as long as it was someone from this school, they would be able to recognize him. 

This person can only be Xu Sheng! It can’t be wrong!

Xiao Chen’s feet were unstable and his head was dizzy. The phone fell from his hand, but luckily the boy next to him was quick off the mark, catching it to prevent it from breaking into two halves.

Xiao Chen staggered and almost fell down, his eyes widening and his breath stuck in his throat. 

He turned sharply, scaring the students near him, their faces pale. There was only one thought in his head: ‘Find Xu Sheng!’

One foot had just crossed the entrance of the classroom when, in the terrified sight of everyone, Xiao Chen collapsed. 

In his disoriented state, Xiao Chen saw one face after another around him, all of them flustered and horrified. But there were also noises of discussion.

“I beg you guys, save me! Save me! I beg you guys!!” A boy cried, his nose running. He harshly hit the door, each howl holding despair. Tears fell one by one, dripping onto the floor. He was like a lone wolf dying of sickness, letting out painful cries. In the dark hallway, no one responded, and the voice-activated lights flickered mysteriously. 

“I know you guys are inside, I beg you guys, save me! I’m going to die! I beg you guys, help me call 120!” The boy grabbed the door handle tightly, smashing the door with all his strength. He thrashed wildly, knocking fiercely on every door in the hallway in desperation.

Xiao Chen stared at the scene in front of him, trying hard to see which boy’s face it was, but it was like a veil of mist covered his eyes. No matter what he did, the boy’s facial features couldn’t be seen, but he could still sense the other’s weak struggle and agonizing shouts. But the boy couldn’t perceive Xiao Chen’s presence. Xiao Chen watched with wide eyes as the boy looked through him, as if he were in another space. 

He examined the boy’s back view, his chest stuffy. He wanted to help the other scream, but his voice was stuck in his throat. His mouth twitched, but he couldn’t produce any sound. He blinked anxiously, but he could only roar in his heart. ‘Quickly open the door! Can’t you guys see that he is about to die?’

Xiao Chen’s prayers in his heart might have had an effect, because with a click, the door at the end of the hallway was opened. The boy brightened like a rescued puppy as he rushed there and hugged the person’s leg, hoarsely saying, “Save me!”

The man kicked the boy indifferently, making sure he was far away. “Don’t get close to me, don’t block this father! Little b*tch, you’re just as cheap as your mother!”

The boy acted like he was someone drowning and thrashing bitterly in the water, before finally seizing the last floating board. He wasn’t deterred, and returned to grab onto the man’s leg even as he was repeatedly kicked.

The boy knelt on the ground and kowtowed strongly. “I beg you to help me call 120, I beg you! I beg you!”

Xiao Chen’s heart cramped and he wished to rush up and pick him up.

The man sneered as if he was looking at a joke. He pulled out his phone. “You want me to call?”

The boy’s eyes were filled with hope, and he nodded vigorously, so fast that Xiao Chen was worried his head would be thrown off. 

The man’s hand swiped across the screen, and Xiao Chen thought he was going to call the emergency number. But in the next second when he saw the screen clearly, he was chilled to the core.

What the man opened was the phone’s recording function! 

He stepped forward and kicked the boy ferociously, his eyes exuding madness and odd satisfaction, as if to vent all his discomfort and resentment on the boy!

The mist shrouding Xiao Chen’s eyes instantly dissipated. At this moment, he could see the appearance of the boy behind it! 

Pale face, light gray eyes! Familiar eyebrows!

The cold sweat on Xiao Chen’s forehead tricked down, and he swallowed.

It’s Xu Sheng!

Bam!

Xiao Chen raised his stiff legs to get rid of the restrictions on his body and pull the boy away. But his body was still partially out of his control, so he toppled to the side, immediately falling unconscious. 

Xiao Chen barely managed to open his eyes, and his surroundings were all as white as snow. He gasped, his head blank for a moment, and ignorantly looked around. There were two male classmates sitting in front of his bed. It took awhile for him to realize he was in the hospital, though he didn’t know how long he had been lying down for. 

He violently sat up, thinking of Xu Sheng, of those pictures and the dream…

Xiao Chen impatiently asked, “Xu Sheng? How is Xu Sheng?”

The expressions of the two boys became a little strange, even frightened. One of them showed disdain, but still a bit of fear. “How else can he be, he did that kind of thing, and someone in the school took those photos. I heard that he committed suicide by taking sleeping pills at home!”

Xiao Chen’s brain couldn’t process it. He bit his lip, his face pale.

The boy continued. “However, I also heard that he regretted it afterwards, but didn’t have any method of communication at home. So he ran out, wanting to call for help from other people in the apartments, but nobody listened to him. So cheap, tut-tut, so tragic.” 

Xiao Chen glanced at the gloating boy, a chill running down his spine. He felt that the world was so unfamiliar.

Out of nowhere, he thought of a saying:

Each snowflake in an avalanche pleads not guilty.

Each of them is an accomplice who killed Xu Sheng!



 The curtain of night slowly descended as the clouds on the horizon were covered with dust. The world darkened, and all beings returned to silence. Everything was so calm, but the more it appeared calm, the more it seemed to hide the arrival of the eye of the storm. 

Bai Qiaoqiao hung up the phone and sneered unsympathetically.

Unexpectedly, that Xu Sheng was so useless. She had not used all her means to deal with him before he committed suicide!

She opened her photo album, which had the photos of Xu Sheng in the bathroom. 

In the photo, Xu Sheng was crouched in the corner, hugging his head. The corners of his mouth were slightly raised, revealing a taunting smile. What surprised her even more was that Xu Sheng actually stared directly at the camera, his pupils blood red, just like a corpse!

She rubbed her eyes, looking at the photo once more. There clearly wasn’t any bloody color, and it was just Xu Sheng helplessly cowering the corner, using his hands to shield his ridiculous body from view. 

Bai Qiaoqiao’s face was pale, and she began to shiver. It was obviously summer, but she felt like she was bathed in winter’s cold, the biting chill striking her. Xu Sheng’s body was already dead, but as Bai Qiaoqiao examined the photo again, she thought it was mysterious.

“D*mn!” Her quivering hand pressed the screen, forcefully deleting all the photos in her phone. But her nervousness didn’t lessen when she did that, so her chest tightened. 

She glanced at her surroundings. It was a pink girl’s bedroom with bags, a wardrobe, a sofa, dolls, and cosmetics…Everything in front of her was familiar, but she was increasingly flustered. This feeling was strangely inexplicable, and especially when the teru teru bozu, which was suspended next to the windowsill, was suddenly given life! A pair of black eyes studied her…

“AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!”

The lights abruptly shut off, and the world returned to silence.

The mirror beside the bed vaguely revealed a black shadow. He stood there quietly and motionlessly, for an unknown amount of time, before disappearing. 

Are you ready?

This is just the beginning of the game.

Let all the sinners die!

Xiao Chen turned off the light and lay on his side in bed. He took a deep breath and his eyes watered. 

In the dim environment, he could only faintly see the outline of his bedroom. He stared at the ceiling and couldn’t sleep for a long time.

“Xu Sheng.” He buried his head in his blanket, his tears wetting the pillowcase as he called out the name in pain.

“It’s all my fault.”

If he didn’t let Xu Sheng become a target, Xu Sheng wouldn’t have been bullied into committing suicide. If he had woken up earlier, Xu Sheng might not have died! It’s all his fault! 

Xiao Chen’s mind was a mess, and plenty of time passed before he was finally so exhausted that he fell asleep. 

But in a place he couldn’t see, the cabinet in the corner of the wall was lit by the moonlight outside. Its shadow slowly distorted, and in an instant, a part broke off. This new shadow started moving on the wall, changing into a humanoid form.

He walked softly and stopped beside Xiao Chen’s figure. He lay down steadily, attempting to merge with Xiao Chen’s own shadow. 

Xiao Chen’s body shook violently. In his dreamy state, he sensed someone caressing his body, a pair of hands sliding down from his waist to his thighs. 

This person seemed to feel the stiffness of Xiao Chen’s body, so he used one of his hands to gently stroke Xiao Chen’s back. He infatuatedly soothed the protruding butterfly bones, repeatedly petting them. 

Senior.

My Senior.

The black shadow let out a satisfied voice in his heart.

The Senior that belongs only to me.

Really obedient. 

Today, the school was a bit gloomy. The weather forecast distinctly projected that it would be very sunny, but the sky was still grey. It wrapped around the entire teaching building, giving people the feeling of being suffocated by an air of death. A layer of mist spread outside, and the school was relatively remote, so there were only camphor trees outside. Under winding leaves, the mist carries an unspeakable danger.

“Do you think that today is colder than usual?”

“It’s okay. It’s the morning, so it will be more chilly than later in the day.”

Among the passing students, there would occasionally be two or three mentioning the abnormal temperature. 

A pale-faced girl scanned the crowd with lifeless eyes, and her limbs were stiff as she walked. 

Someone recognized her. “Isn’t that Bai Qiaoqiao? Why does she look like a ghost today? She didn’t even put on her makeup.” 

“Hey, Qiaoqiao.” A girl saw Bai Qiaoqiao coming over and enthusiastically went up to pat the other on the shoulder. Bai Qiaoqiao twisted her head and grinned at the girl, before expressionlessly continuing forward. She left the girl standing alone in her original position, cold sweat oozing from her pores. 

The girl swallowed her saliva. The hand which had touched Bai Qiaoqiao was freezing, as if the girl had grabbed a handful of ice. It was a frigid thorn that penetrated into her body.

And when Bai Qiaoqiao looked at her, the girl horrifyingly discovered that only Bai Qiaoqiao’s head had rotated! Not her neck! When those eyes stared at her, the girl felt a chill down her spine. She couldn’t see herself reflected in Bai Qiaoqiao’s eyes! They were only black and empty! 

The girl’s body softened and her legs began to shake. Just as she nearly knelt down, a pair of hands held her. 

She turned her head, but when she found who had supported her, she blanked out.

It’s actually her!

Gao Xuhan glanced at Bai Qiaoqiao’s back in the distance, and then returned to observe the girl she had caught. “What happened to Bai Qiaoqiao? Why do I think that she is behaving weirdly?” 

The girl’s face whitened, and her lips were quivering. “Bai Qiaoqiao is a ghost!”

“What?”

“What I’ve said is all true!” The girl was clearly agitated. “Her body temperature is extremely low, the same as ice! When she turned her head, her neck didn’t move! It was solely her head!”

Gao Xuhan pondered and frowned. After the girl was pulled away by someone nearby, she lifted the corner of her mouth. 

It has started!

Gao Xuhan, or to be precise, Xuhan, was a college student. She normally enjoyed watching horror movies, and who knew that when she watched one called “Thriller High School” yesterday, she would wake up in another body after going to bed. She received unfamiliar fragments of memories in her mind, becoming a high school student, Gao Xuhan! 

And this Gao Xuhan is the heroine of “Thriller High School”!

This film was about the story of a boy named Xu Sheng, who committed suicide because of being bullied on the school campus. He eventually turned into a ghost and retaliated against the whole high school. 

Gao Xuhan was Xu Sheng’s classmate. She was timid and afraid of being involved in anything, so she was as transparent as air. In the entire class, except for her, everyone bullied Xu Sheng. And because of her sympathy, she had shared an umbrella with him when two girls stole his own on a rainy day. This made Xu Sheng have different feelings for her. 

At the end of the movie, all the people, including the teachers, were massacred! However, she survived!

But among them, Bai Qiaoqiao, Zhou Qingqing, Li Ni, Yellow Hair, and Xiao Chen were given priority because they bullied and humiliated Xu Sheng! They all died very brutally, while others were killed more mercifully. 

And it was for this reason that Xuhan had no fear. She held a gold medal of pardon in her hand. Anyways, she wasn’t scared of anything, but she should act like it really was a survival game for her. Maybe she would be able to go home once everyone was dead! 

Gao Xuhan lifted her head towards the rooftop of the first year teaching building. She soundlessly walked back and sat down on a bench not too far from it.

Quite a few of the people around her glanced at her like she was a fool. Obviously, there were only three minutes left until class, but this person was actually sitting here unmoving! Of course, Xu Han noticed what they were doing, but she was still indifferent.

They could keep on laughing. Once Bai Qiaoqiao jumped off the rooftop, she would be able to see a good show. How could she miss it? In the movie, when Bai Qiaoqiao died, her brain matter was smashed out. Xu Han wanted to know if it was true! 

Just as she was thinking about this, a figure appeared on the roof.

Bai Qiaoqiao stood at the edge of the rooftop, her expression dull. She spread out her arms and began to lean forward. Suddenly, her pupils refocused. In that moment, her confusion changed into panic! She saw that her shadow did not move with her, but instead transformed into a ghost!

Her eyes widened as her entire body fell down the floors. Who is it? Who is he?

But Bai Qiaoqiao would never know the answer in this lifetime. Because she had already completely lost consciousness!

Bam!

A hole was torn in Bai Qiaoqiao’s body as she hit the pavement. At this time, a girl happened to walk downstairs, and was a mere half a meter away from Bai Qiaoqiao’s body! She was so close that some of Bai Qiaoqiao’s blood splattered onto her face, and a part of the other’s brain matter stuck onto her neck!

“AHHHHHH!”

“AHHHHHH!”

Hell!

It has started, hasn’t it?



 Xiao Chen opened his eyes, the sunlight from outside the window making him somewhat dizzy. He placed his hand on his forehead, his body feeling as if it had been crushed by a heavy weight. His waist ached and his back hurt. His neck was especially sore, and stiff from his tightened muscles. 

Xiao Chen’s eyes flickered as he barely managed to prop himself up. 

After getting out of bed, he went straight into the bathroom. But once he saw himself in the mirror, he jumped in fright. His swollen eyes were sunken in, but what made him unable to believe his sight were the scattered bruises, which were almost identical to kiss marks. He had just taken a glance, but he already appeared exhausted and hollowed. 

He touched his neck, a little anxious.

His parents were executives at a foreign company, so they basically lived abroad. There was no one else in the house! He was certain that his parents hadn’t returned yet!

Then who was it? And not to mention, he hadn’t been the least bit aware when it all happened!

The doors and windows in the room were intact, and there were no traces of his stuff being overturned. There was nothing that was different than usual.

Wait! That’s not right!

Xiao Chen walked out of the room and smelled the faint aroma of food. His eyes widened, and he handily picked up a broom from beside him, changing into a defensive stance. He leaned against the wall and moved carefully into the kitchen, afraid that any sound would disturb the person in the kitchen.

However.

Xiao Chen looked around.

There was nobody. 

He clenched the broom in his hand, his expression stiff, and even a little terrified. 

The table was already set with many kinds of breakfast. There was bread, pho, and rice. Even a cup of milk was lovingly placed among the items. The milk was obviously freshly warmed, and still emitted heat. But he was unable to ignore the tender and beautiful rose arranged on the table. 

Xiao Chen’s body slightly shook. 

What does this mean? Does this mean that a stranger sneaked into his home while he was asleep, left dense kiss marks on his neck, and may have even done more?

And him! He didn’t know anything!

As Xiao Chen thought about it, he didn’t notice that the shadow under his feet was enveloped by a group of black shadows. That group of black shadows seemed extremely humanoid, and tightly embraced Xiao Chen in a gesture of absolute possession. At first glance, it was just like two people were inseparably entangled, even in death.

Senior!

His Senior!

The black shadow laughed silently.

Xiao Chen only returned to school at noon. When he suddenly fainted last time, it could be said that the students and teachers were very frightened. As the top student, he was brought up to be the focus and the face of the whole school. A lot of importance was attached to him, so he was allowed specifically to rest at home for a few more days. 

After Xu Sheng’s case blew up, the school suppressed the news as soon as possible and hid the real reason for Xu Sheng’s suicide. It was passed off with a simple summary of depression and being bullied by classmates. The fact that Xu Sheng liked Xiao Chen was never included.

But that post about Xu Sheng was deleted by the school authorities a day after everything happened. The person who posted it also surfaced and was punished. However, the rest of Xu Sheng’s bullies were given nothing more than a lecture. They only stayed at home for a few days, later sending in a request for academic probation! 

In order to protect the school’s reputation, no rumors were allowed to leak out.

And when Xiao Chen knew the results of the school’s handling of the bullies, he was so angry that his teeth itched! He immediately pulled people over to ask about the masterminds of the incident in the bathroom. 

They were actually all Xu Sheng’s classmates! One was called Bai Qiaoqiao, and the other was called Wang Tong, who was actually Yellow Hair. He had bullied Xu Sheng in the cafeteria that day!

With Bai Qiaoqiao responsible for spreading word, Wang Tong led people to teach Xu Sheng a lesson in the bathroom.

Confucius once said: Repay enmity with good.

Who is joking, Confucius’s original words were: If you repay enmity with good, how then will you repay good? Repay good with good, and repay enmity with justice. 

Xiao Chen knew that these things couldn’t be left alone!

But even when it was all revealed, the perpetrators did not pay a lot. They were lectured, fined, detained for a few days, and then returned to the campus to continue to bully others! And those who were bullied could only endure the humiliation and swallow their insults. They would perennially experience unbearable bullying. They couldn’t do anything as they were punched and kicked, slandered, ridiculed, and isolated! Because they understood that the more they fought back, the more terrifying the bullying would be! The result of this, with almost no exceptions, was that they were finally unable to withstand it, choosing instead to commit suicide.

Xu Sheng was not the first! And he will not be the last!

So, this matter must not be settled with just this!

Xiao Chen yawned, strolling on the sidewalk outside of school. The surrounding camphor trees cast mottled shadows. Beneath Xiao Chen’s feet, the dark mass slowly morphed into the shape of a heart. Wherever he went, the shadows became hearts. When he looked away, they even changed into flowers! A few tiny kittens observed the bizarre and strange shadows, and saw that Xiao Chen was in low spirits. They went up to play with him so he could cheer up. 

If this startling occurrence met with anyone else, they would be scared out of their wits. Xiao Chen’s reaction was surprisingly calm.

He took deep breaths for two seconds, and his footsteps halted. He clenched his hands firmly as a bold idea formed in his mind. Probingly, he spoke towards the location of the trees’ shadow. “Who are you? Are you human?”

The shadow paused for a few moments, before transforming into a word, ‘No’.

Xiao Chen was slightly astonished, but afterwards, it became horror. 

He hesitated as he thought of something. He continued to ask, “The breakfast in my house was made by you?”

‘En.’ This time, it replied very quickly. 

Xiao Chen’s expression was somewhat weird. “The kiss marks on my neck are also from you?”

The trees’ shadows were restored to their normal speckled appearance. Just when Xiao Chen thought he wouldn’t receive a response, the shadows regrouped. ‘Yes, I like you. Behind you, there is a big heart. Two words, Xiao Chen, are written inside.’ 

Xiao Chen stopped talking, a bit speechless. Although he didn’t know what this guy wanted to do, he could be certain of one thing. This unknown entity did not carry animosity towards him.

Now that this was brought up, it was odd. Xiao Chen was not interested in the folktales of gods and monsters, but when such existences appeared next to him, he was not bewildered. Perhaps he was still afraid, but had a faint feeling of something else. A world like this might just be the true world. 

How can there be policemen?

With his sharp eyes, Xiao Chen spotted yellow caution tape around the first year teaching building. It was clearly after school hours, but no one had left the classrooms. There was also a unit of police cars parked at the front, making people feel that something was wrong. 

Is it for Xu Sheng?

Suspiciously, he was blocked by the security at the entrance. The security guard obviously recognized him, and said, “Wait for a while, child, don’t go into campus today!”

“What’s wrong? Uncle, what’s going on in school?” 

The security guard was solemn as he put his mouth near Xiao Chen’s ear and whispered, “A girl jumped off the first year teaching building and committed suicide. The police are still investigating.” He didn’t know if it was an illusion, but the instant he told Xiao Chen this, he felt cold all over, leading him to shudder unconsciously.

In fact, in a place he couldn’t see, a black thing attached to him.

“A girl? What’s her name?”

If it was someone else, the security guard might not have answered, but Xiao Chen was really a lovely boy. When he noticed the security guard at school, he would warmly call ‘Uncle’, and he also looked very pleasing to the eye. Therefore, after the security cautiously checked that there was no one else around, he said in a low voice, “It seems to be a Bai Qiuqiu.”

“Bai Qiaoqiao.” Xiao Chen corrected him.

“Right, that’s the one, it’s this name. You know this student?” The security was a little amazed.

Xiao Chen shook his head. “I’m not familiar with her.” But his heart was a turbulence of waves, raging waves which pounded the banks. His heartbeat accelerated, so fast that he could almost hear the sound of the beating. Cold sweat came out involuntarily.

Did Bai Qiaoqiao commit suicide out of guilt?

No, that’s not possible!

Xiao Chen swiftly rejected this conjecture.

Why decide to commit suicide in school? And even choosing a place with many people! It was meant to be viewed by a crowd.

Xiao Chen frowned.

This was similar to a punishment, where everyone could see her miserable appearance!

A trailer for what was to come!

Xiao Chen kept staring at the shadow under his feet, a bold guess suddenly emerging in his mind. If there really were things in this world that could not be explained, then why couldn’t Xu Sheng return for revenge after death?



 “Motherf*cker, how long will it take! It’s been an entire morning! Class isn’t over, breaks aren’t allowed, and we have to even request to go to the bathroom! It’s already noon! Are they going to let us starve during lunch?”

“Right, right, isn’t it just a suicide? It’s not as if it’s murder! Why are they making such a big deal out of it?”

The students started whispering, their voices growing louder and louder as time went on.

“Quiet! All of you be quiet!” The students’ mood was increasingly excited, leaving the teachers helpless. The higher-ups gave firm instructions for them to calm the students down, but they were stuck in a deadlock. 

Liu Chunming looked at the students under stage, gritting his teeth as he said, “Within three days, two lives were lost in your class! Do you guys not know how to reflect on yourself?!”

As the head teacher, he would be held responsible and blamed. The school authorities had already begun to clean up the situation. He was even considering the idea that to become a good teacher, he needed to pay attention to the student’s psychological education. 

It was Xu Sheng first, then Bai Qiaoqiao. It wasn’t easy for the school authorities to suppress the news of Xu Sheng’s death so that it didn’t spread and influence the public. Unfortunately, Bai Qiaoqiao’s matter happened. What’s more, it occurred on campus, and too many students had seen it. There were a few students who were so scared they fainted on the spot. Even if the school wanted to conceal it, they couldn’t. Not only that, but two deaths in a row attracted the police’s attention.

One is the bully and one is the victim. The time between their deaths was no more than three days. Excluding the fact that it was suicide, many reporters in the city wanted to cover this for their next news article. 

“Hey, do you think that Bai Qiaoqiao was so stimulated by Xu Sheng’s death that she committed suicide out of guilt?” A boy used his elbow to jab another boy next to him in the chest, whispering this. 

“How is that possible? You don’t know the character of Bai Qiaoqiao, this person. I would rather believe that Xu Sheng turned into a ghost and came back for revenge!” The other boy snickered.

“Hahaha.” The people around them laughed together. 

“Peng!” The table was fiercely smacked. 

“All of you be quiet for this father!” It was Wang Tong.

The scattered discussions abruptly stopped, and there was a period of silence. 

Wang Tong’s expression was dark, and his hands were clenched tightly into fists. His legs were crossed in a relaxed posture, like he was a stranger to the rest of his classmates.

The two boys looked at each other and did not speak.

If there really was a ghost, then wasn’t it Wang Tong’s turn next? Who didn’t know that it was Wang Tong who led people to humiliate Xu Sheng in the bathroom that day.

The two boys’ brains were magically connected by radio waves, and they both felt a little like they were watching a good show. But they completely forgot that they too had coldly observed the bullying that day. If Xu Sheng wanted vengeance, he wouldn’t spare any of them!

Gao Xuhan was in her seat, glancing at her surroundings mockingly. The original owner of her body had a low presence. She sat silently in the corner by herself. Especially in such a tense atmosphere, no one perceived her existence. And when Gao Xuhan wrote something in her notebook, nobody cared.

Bai Qiaoqiao → Liu Chunming → Wang Tong → Zhou Qingqing → Li Ni → Xiao Chen → Massacre.

She recalled the contents of the movie, writing the killing order while also peeking at Liu Chunming, who was sitting at the podium. She then moved her gaze to Wang Tong, who was in his own seat, radiating chilliness. She sneered.

The next one is Liu Chunming. 

Gao Xuhan was actually a little excited. She was not only a fan of horror movies, but also a fan of novels. She enjoyed the romance genre, but in particular, novels about ghost wives and ghost marriage. 

The sole reason why she watched “Thriller High School” was because there was a romantic relationship including the ghost. In the ending of the movie, Gao Xuhan dazedly passed by corpse after corpse, before walking out of the school campus alone. In the moment she left, a large fire began to spread. Later, the post-credits scene showed Gao Xuhan and Xu Sheng in love as they shared an umbrella.

The end.

Gao Xuhan secretly had some expectations. Actually, she really wished to see Xu Sheng because she remembered that he was played by a popular movie star. That star had a pair of peach blossom eyes and a very high nose bridge. He was simply Gao Xuhan’s ideal lover. Based on appearance, the main characters and cannon fodder played by actors were not similar to their counterparts in this world. However, their personalities and outfits were exactly the same.

Furthermore, she had examined Wang Tong and Bai Qiaoqiao. They were not inferior to the actors in the movie. If this was true, Xu Sheng would not be worse either.

In her mind, Gao Xuhan had even made up a love story with Xu Sheng, complete with a bit of mystery. 

She smirked. Whether everyone lived or died had nothing to do with her.

Gao Xuhan lowered her head and raised the corner of her mouth.

If needed, she didn’t mind helping Xu Sheng kill someone herself.

Liu Chunming had a headache. He supported his forehead with a hand as cold sweat dripped down his skin. Somehow, his chest also started to feel stuffy. He quickly drank a sip of water, but only found that his body was cooling. The soles of his feet began to sweat, and he had slight trouble breathing. 

He put down the thermos, sighing. When he stared at it again, the goji in his drink had actually transformed into a redworm. It was slowly wriggling, its body twisting and turning.

“Retch.” Liu Chunming violently threw up, wanting to spit out the liquid he had just swallowed. He rolled onto his side and dry heaved, using all his strength to thump his chest, but was only able to let out saliva. His hands struck increasingly harder as he felt more and more nauseous. He almost looked like he was coughing up blood. All the students in the class raised their heads at once, gawking at him in horror and hoping it was all an act.

After Liu Chunming found that what he was doing was useless, he unexpectedly began to scratch his throat with his hands. The students in the first row could clearly see that his sharp, black nails pierced his skin. Bright red blood leaked out.

At this time, Liu Chunming didn’t vomit. Upon discovering him, the girl sitting under the podium was hit by an overwhelming sense of disgust, causing her to empty out her stomach. A revolting yellow haze of sourness pervaded the air, mixed with undigested rice, snacks, and fruit from lunch. 

Instantly, several people followed the girl, making the repulsive smell even worse. 

Others might not have noticed, but Gao Xuhan ’s focus had always been on Liu Chunming’s shadow. At first glance, she had located a replica of Liu Chunming in the shadow. This Liu Chunming grabbed his own neck, appearing like he was about to commit suicide.

Gao Xuhan flipped through her memories of the plot. She distinctly remembered that when Xu Sheng killed people, he controlled the souls within his victims’ shadows during the day. Once night fell, he slaughtered without restrictions. 

Therefore.

Gao Xuhan’s body shivered.

Xu Sheng is now in the classroom!!

But her shaking did not stem from fear, but from anticipation.

Xiao Chen looked around. At the only place where the security cameras were broken, he nimbly jumped and climbed up the nearest camphor tree. He smoothly ascended until he was at the same height as the top of the wall. Then, he leapt off. His movements were like flowing water, as if he had practiced countless times.

The campus was still, not to mention students, even teachers couldn’t be seen walking out.

Xiao Chen had pulled someone over and asked them where Xu Sheng’s classroom was. Xu Sheng was a first year student. Before the idea in Xiao Chen’s mind could be confirmed, he had to go to Xu Sheng’s class and ask someone about the current circumstances.

As Xiao Chen circled around to the back door of the first year teaching building, he saw a bald man suddenly push open the door and hurriedly run out. The man had a beer belly and the typical ‘Mediterranean’ hairstyle. His overall appearance was very greasy. The man gripped his chest and kneeled down on the patch of flowers outside the building. 

With a briefcase in his hand, Liu Chunming returned to the classroom expressionlessly. The hygiene in the classroom was barely restored by two or three students who were in charge of cleaning duty that day. They could only pinch their noses and reluctantly do the work.

When Liu Chunming entered, all the students had basically returned to their seats. 

Liu Chunming had a mysterious aura. He stood on the podium and lifted the corner of his mouth. “I am a sinner.”

“?”

Confusion was written all over his students’ faces.

Liu Chunming’s eyes were empty, ignoring everyone else as he continued, “I have long known that Xu Sheng was targeted by bullies. Whether it be when he was locked in the bathroom stall, when you guys deliberately threw his books in the garbage can, or when you guys put nails on his seat. I pretended to realize nothing because I had an agreement with Bai Qiaoqiao. As long as I disregarded this matter, her father would transfer me to a key high school in the city instead of dwelling here and being an ordinary teacher.

”What?!” All the students exclaimed.

“I’m a sinner. Even the death penalty will not compensate for my sin. I should be responsible for Xu Sheng’s death.” Liu Chunming emotionlessly finished his words. Then, he took out a knife from his handbag.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

“AHHHHHHH!!!!”

All the students were so frightened that they shrieked, but it was not like they didn’t want to rush out of the classroom. Their legs seemed to be fixed to their chairs. They desperately attempted to control their bodies, but it was futile. Even their eyes couldn’t be moved by them. They could only stare at the scene, a blink turning into a luxury as their eyes dried.

Liu Chunming sneered. As if he couldn’t feel pain, he ruthlessly thrust the kitchen knife into his abdomen. But immediately after the blood splattered out, his originally impassive face changed into an appalled one. His expression twisted hideously, but he could not produce any sound. His blood-curdling screams were muffled as his mouth remained closed. The hand holding the knife relentlessly penetrated his flesh, as if his hands weren’t numb as he savagely stabbed himself.

Do you guys know?

Near death, there is a kind of desperate pain where one can only despairingly watch as their life drains away. I will let you guys experience it too! The Bible says, “The joy of sin only lasts for a moment, but its suffering is forever.”



 Xiao Chen wordlessly waited for a few minutes before cautiously walking out of the corner. He arrived at the back door of the first year teaching building again. 

But in the second his foot crossed the entrance, he unexpectedly found himself at the school gate outside the walls. He turned around, dumfounded, and tapped the wall. It really was the concrete wall.

He had actually returned to his original location!

And the shadow under his feet was being hugged by another human-like shadow. At first glance, Xiao Chen saw this scene. He suddenly felt dissatisfied in his heart as he asked, “You brought me out?”

The shadow that was embracing him paused for a moment, slightly embarrassed for being caught. Although Xiao Chen couldn’t see anything different, he could sense the shadow’s arms around him. The contact was light and hard to detect, but possibly because he lacked the visual stimulus, he was extra sensitive and couldn’t ignore it.

Mr. Shadow hesitantly manipulated the shadow of the large tree nearby and said, ‘En.’

Xiao Chen was somewhat amused. He didn’t know why, but he thought that Mr. Shadow was trying to act cute.

“Why don’t you want me to go in?”

Perhaps even Xiao Chen didn’t notice that his tone was very similar to that of a boyfriend’s coaxing when his girlfriend was being naughty. 

Mr. Shadow regained control of the tree shadow and said, ‘Dangerous.’

Xiao Chen was stunned. “You mean, it’s dangerous inside?”

The shadow continued to cuddle him, but it nodded vigorously, worried that Xiao Chen would not understand. 

Xiao Chen nodded as well to show that he knew, his expression solemn. 

In his heart, he secretly said, ‘I’m afraid Xu Sheng really came back.’

Bai Qiaoqiao was now dead, so who would be next?

Would it be him?

Xiao Chen abruptly felt cramps in his stomach, and it was a bit difficult to breathe. 

Then, why didn’t Xiao Chen suspect that Mr. Shadow was Xu Sheng?

The reason was actually very simple. From his perspective, he was also an accomplice in Xu Sheng’s death. Xu Sheng would definitely not let him go, but Mr. Shadow was full of goodwill towards him. Since Mr. Shadow had tried to keep him safe, he didn’t connect him with Xu Sheng.

Xiao Chen’s face was the color of ash. He grit his teeth and looked at the wall behind him once more. He stared at it intensely for a long time. As if he had made up his mind, he took a deep breath and walked forward several steps to assure himself. He suddenly jumped onto the tree trunk, intending to climb up. 

Before Xiao Chen’s legs could reach the campus’s wall, they were unexpectedly entangled with the tree branches. The branches began to move as flexibly as vines. They even tied his legs together so that he couldn’t use them. 

Xiao Chen was shocked. He attempted to pull the branches away, but his hands were soon bound by another bunch of branches which emerged from behind him. Now, he was only hanging on the tree.

A numbing sensation invaded Xiao Chen’s heart as he felt his neck being continuously rubbed, someone’s breath brushing against his skin. 

It seemed like a thousand ants were nibbling his neck. It didn’t hurt, but it was itchy.

Xiao Chen unconsciously wanted to break free. The invisible being appeared to understand his rejection, so it carefully dropped something on his forehead and gently comforted him.

That something was a pair of lips

Xiao Chen struggled even more fiercely. “Quickly let me go!”

The lips that were pressed to his forehead moved away. The branches that were wrapped around his hands and feet loosened their hold, retreating to where they came from.

Xiao Chen was puzzled for a while, but he couldn’t spare the time to think about it. Immediately, he flipped over the wall, into the school campus.

The black shadow smiled.

Senior.

I will protect you.

Since entering this world, this was the first time Gao Xuhan truly met with the threat of death. Her tears flowed without pause, and her face was pale from fear. Her mouth refused to open, like it was sewn shut, as she let out whimpers.

What was even more terrifying was that the surrounding environment was being swallowed by a mass of black things at a speed visible to the naked eye. The walls, blackboards, electric lights, and the doors and windows decomposed as if they were dipped into sulfuric acid. They all disappeared into a bottomless pit.

Gao Xuhan’s cold sweat poured out, and she cried with everyone else as their legs were attacked by the black mass. It slowly proceeded upwards.

It went from their legs to their waist, to their neck, all the way until their entire body had completely vanished within the darkness.

Xiao Chen drove a light car on a familiar road and returned to the back door of the first year teaching building.

He lightly pushed open the door and put one leg inside as a test. He made sure that he was not sent back outside the campus walls. It was only after this that he walked in vigilantly. 

What happened?

As soon as Xiao Chen was in the building, he noticed something was wrong.

Xu Sheng was a first year student, and his class was precisely the one closest to the back door. Therefore, Xiao Chen had chosen to take the back entrance. 

However.

Xiao Chen swallowed. The whole classroom was actually empty!!

He inexplicably headed to another class. In this state, Xiao Chen was extremely alert, to the point where he could even hear the husky sound of the wind.

Wrong! There is no one in this classroom either!

Xiao Chen’s heart beat irregularly, and he almost forgot to breathe. He immediately had some regrets, and decided to leave. But at this moment, he surprisingly discovered that the door behind him was gone without a trace!

It had become a wall!

A chill ran down Xiao Chen’s spine. He squeezed his hands nervously, before he abruptly spotted something.

The words on the placard of Class 4, Xu Sheng’s class, looked strange, but Xiao Chen couldn’t put his finger on it. 

Xiao Chen forced himself to calm down and observe the situation.

Then, he realized it. The words were completely opposite from the ones in reality!

Xiao Chen felt ridiculous now. Was he in the real world?

His memory was very good, so he remembered all the details in his life freshly. He examined all the paintings hanging outside the various classrooms on the first floor. Although he had only visited the first year teaching building a few times, he was confident that the paintings were different!

His gaze was cold as he frowned.

But next, Xiao Chen’s eyes widened. Yes, even the directions of these paintings were reversed!

He had a wild speculation in his mind. Could it be that this was the Otherworld?

Xiao Chen once read a book in the library with the title of “Real World”. In this book, the author divided the world into three parts: the Fog World, the Otherworld, and the Real World. The Fog World and the Otherworld were both illusory, but the Fog World was much less hostile than the Otherworld. The Otherworld was different! It symbolized evil, bloodshed, darkness, and violence. There were countless wicked monsters. 

Anyone who was pulled into this world would never survive.

Xiao Chen looked out the window and was shocked. He had entered the building at noon, but currently the sky showed that it was dusk, with a faint glow of red light.

“AH!” An ear-piercing shriek resounded through the air, making Xiao Chen almost lose his balance.

Xiao Chen peered behind him. At this time, he saw two or three girls on the staircase. They stared at him with horror-struck expressions. When they recognized Xiao Chen, they somewhat relaxed. “Senior Xiao Chen?”

The girls wore Chong Guang High School uniforms, so it wasn’t weird that they knew who he was. But to his alarm, there were actually other people in this world! How many people were there in total?

Xiao Chen strode in their direction, but the girls unconsciously shrank together and took a step back. At this moment, Xiao Chen observed that the girls were pale, and there were numerous patches of dirt on their clothes. It didn’t seem like they had just got here. What made him speechless was that one of them was covered in blood. If it wasn’t for the girl hiding in the back, Xiao Chen wouldn’t have needed to get closer to see the blood.

“What happened to you guys? Why are things like this?” Xiao Chen said, wanting to advance a little more towards the girls.

“Senior Xiao Chen, don’t come over right now!” The girl standing at the front appeared to be the leader of the group. Although she looked embarrassed, her eyes were firmly locked onto Xiao Chen. It was almost as if she would attack him if he went near, just like a mother eagle guarding her children.

Xiao Chen instantly stopped.

The girl explained, “Senior Xiao Chen, I will tell you the story briefly. This is not the real world at all. When night falls, monsters will surface!” After she said this, the other girl behind her couldn’t help but tremble.

“It’s Xu Sheng who has returned for revenge!” The leader clenched her teeth, but she abruptly thought of something. Her sight focused on Xiao Chen. When Xiao Chen heard the two words ‘Xu Sheng’, he secretly said in his mind, ‘As expected.’

“Monsters will not show up during the day, but they will at night! And two people must die every night if the rest want to live!”

“How do you know?” Xiao Chen was astonished and asked a question.

The girl let out a self-deprecating laugh. “There is a broadcast.”

How laughable! Everyone in Class 4 was an accomplice who led to Xu Sheng’s death. Xu Sheng would not have mercy on any of them. He crafted a ghastly game to force them to kill each other!

They would murder their own classmates in exchange for the possibility of survival. If they didn’t do it, the monsters would do it for them. But the number of people killed by the monsters was not counted towards the two people who had to die!

Last night, the group of girls had watched with large eyes as a bunch of evil classmates murdered two students who had no friends and a low sense of presence in the class.

Everyone was expressionless as it all occurred, and no one had dared to stop those perpetrators.

And the girls knew females were viewed as the weaker sex, so they would most likely be the next ones to be eliminated!

So, they had to hide.

But nevertheless! In the end, all the people will die!



 The sound of the broadcast abruptly traveled to everyone’s ears. It was distinctly the mechanical voice of a male without the slightest bit of emotion. Like it was reading aloud from a text, the voice flatly delivered a message, occasionally interrupted by static. {There is half an hour left until night falls. Players, please prepare yourselves.}

The girls widened their eyes, their panic surfacing as they started to shake.

Xiao Chen swiftly recovered. “How many people are in this world, and how large is our movement range? We need to quickly hide now.”

The leader of the girls grit her teeth. “There are not a lot of people. It’s only the students in Class 4 and you. We can move within the whole school.”

Xiao Chen was doubtful. “The entire school? Then why not climb over the wall and escape?”

One of the girls broke down. “Do you think that we haven’t thought of that? Do you know what happened to those people after they ran away?!”

Xiao Chen instantly stopped talking. This world was not the Real World. Even if they fled the school, what was outside? Who knew?

He hung his head, and the atmosphere became somber. 

He suddenly sensed something touch his neck, and then a pair of hands attached themselves to his waist. 

This gave Xiao Chen goosebumps. When he looked downwards, he couldn’t see anything, and the girls didn’t notice any abnormalities. 

Was it the ghost that had warned him about this world? Or Xu Sheng?

Xiao Chen could clearly feel its lips moving closer to his ear, until it began to rub his earlobe tenderly. A magnetic and husky male voice murmured, “Go to the library.”

The arms restraining him disappeared. Xiao Chen stroked his ear. It was a little red.

Xiao Chen chose to believe the ghost.

If his words were true, then they might be able to live. But if his words were false, then they would only die a bit earlier than the others.

Not to mention.

Xiao Chen squeezed his hand firmly.

He didn’t know why, but he had a random hunch that the ghost would not harm him.

“Let’s go to the library.” Xiao Chen did not hesitate to share the information. The girls raised their heads in surprise, but the situation was urgent and they had no other choice. After a while, they all followed Xiao Chen’s suggestions.

Night came.

Xiao Chen frowned.

Monsters would appear at night, so what monsters were there?

Xiao Chen repeatedly asked this question to the girls, but their expressions were so terror-struck that Xiao Chen couldn’t push them any further. 

It was at this moment that the library’s intercom had another broadcast. The girls were so scared that they huddled together. 

{Players, welcome to night time! The rules of the game have been changed twice. 

Next are the new rules. The game mission has been renamed to ‘Find the Sinner’. Sinners are hidden among you all. According to the prompts, you must locate the designated sinner and punish them.

Finding the sinner will award an escape quota.

Through the votes of all people, a final sinner will be selected. Whether the accused person is the sinner or not, they will be punished.

And today’s prompt is: Library.

The time limit is two hours. Afterwards, punishment will be dealt. Remember, the God of Death is right behind you. 

Good luck.}

The girls’ eyes brightened as they were faintly excited. 

The last game’s mission, which demanded two dead every night, was a downright slaughter. There was no chance of survival! Each of them held despair at the certainty of death.

Now that there was a way for them to live, how could they not be thrilled?

The short-haired girl, the leader of the girls, reacted the fastest. She glanced at the stunned Xiao Chen, and then said, “We are currently in the library, quickly go look for clues! We can definitely live!”

The girl rapidly stood up and walked around the library to search.

Xiao Chen tightly shut his eyes. He thought things were not so simple, and that the library itself was the clue. 

Sinner.

What sin? Why are they guilty? What crime did they commit?

If this was an Otherworld created by Xu Sheng, then the sinner’s sin must have been related to Xu Sheng!

Or, in the library, they must have wronged Xu Sheng.

So, will the sinner know that they are the sinner?

“Ah!” The curly-haired girl was startled and shrieked. 

“What wrong?”

“Xiao Ping, are you okay? What happened?”

Upon hearing the girl, Xiao Chen immediately ran over.

The library wasn’t small. It had an upper floor and a lower floor with many separate rooms. Xiao Chen and the girls had split into groups of two.

Gao Xuhan was shrinking in the corner, and she looked a little embarrassed. 

“It’s you!” The girls almost instantly recognized her, and they loosened their initial guard.

Gao Xuhan’s spirit was beginning to collapse. Because the development of the plot was completely different from the movie she had watched!

In the movie, after Xu Sheng turned into a ghost, he massacred all the students in the school. Why was only Class 4 going to die? Obviously, she was Xu Sheng’s sweetheart, so why was she in this world as well? Why were Zhou Qingqing, Li Ni, and Xiao Chen, these three plot characters, not here?

What’s going on? What actually occurred? Where is this place?

Especially after she saw two students being murdered last night, she went absolutely crazy! She didn’t want to die! She really didn’t want to!

Xiao Chen came forward as Gao Xuhan lifted her head. But the moment she noticed him, she immediately screamed. “AHHHHHHH!!”

Gao Xuhan knew who he was with one glance. 

Xiao Chen looked too gorgeous! Next to him, all the girls present could only be inferior. Xiao Chen’s biggest selling point was his pair of lucky phoenix eyes. Although the actor who played Xiao Chen was also handsome, compared with the Xiao Chen in front of Gao Xuhan, he was merely mediocre. 

Xiao Chen was frightened by her screams and took a few steps back.

In a corner that no one could see, a black shadow stood there silently and motionlessly. Wisps of black smoke emitted from its body gloomily.

D*mn woman! You actually scared my Senior!

Gao Xuhan recalled how Xiao Chen died. 

In the movie, Xiao Chen was a rich second generation, and he had an ambiguous relationship with Zhou Qingqing. For her sake, along with his own prideful nature, he was unsatisfied with Xu Sheng. 

He spread false rumours of Xu Sheng’s sexual orientation. Then, Xiao Chen united with Wang Tong and Bai Qiaoqiao to humiliate Xu Sheng in the bathroom. 

The person Xu Sheng hated the most was unquestionably Xiao Chen! 

He had killed Xiao Chen by linchi!

One cut after another.

Even if the director didn’t shoot it all, it was disgusting enough.

How could Gao Xuhan dare to approach him? In the movie, Xu Sheng deliberately made him the last one in order to torment him. The people who died fast were basically those who were close to Xiao Chen. Xu Sheng used this method to play with Xiao Chen’s mind, refusing to let him die peacefully. 

Gao Xuhan cried. She was too naive! How could a ghost be a good thing? What ghost wife? What love between a ghost and a human? How could these be more important than her life?

Xiao Chen realized that her emotional state was weird. He frowned, and the girls around him looked at each other. Ultimately, they all dispersed to search for clues again. 

There were only two hours. In this time that would decide life or death, no one had the mood to go and comfort Gao Xuhan.

When Wang Tong brought people into the library, he appeared cold and tired. His whole body exuded a bloody air. 

Xiao Chen peeked at the large team behind him. Everyone stared at Wang Tong with extreme fear. No one dared to be near him, and Wang Tong himself understood that.

Last night, it might not have been Wang Tong who personally killed the two people.

Wang Tong saw Xiao Chen instantly when he entered. His eyes widened, but he had mixed feelings and didn’t approach Xiao Chen.

Of course, everyone else had also noticed Xiao Chen. When they thought of the rumors between him and Xu Sheng, they were alarmed.

“Holy cow, the library is so big! What can we find?”

“Right, this clue is too useless. There isn’t any light, so we can’t even read the words properly!”

“Shut up!” Hearing people secretly complaining, Wang Tong sent sharp daggers towards them with his sight. Immediately, they were quiet.

Xiao Chen observed as the group aimlessly and messily flipped pages. He stopped walking.

His shadow was cast onto the floor by the weak moonlight. But the him in the shadow was in a different position. The distinction was very subtle, and if he hadn’t unconsciously looked down, he wouldn’t have found this at all!

The sole difference was that the index finger of his left hand in the shadow pointed to someone.



 Xiao Chen was shocked. He looked towards the place the finger pointed to.

It was near the window, with bookshelves almost completely blocking the view. He couldn’t see that clearly, and could only vaguely detect that there was a rather petite, short-haired girl. 

Observing this distant figure, Xiao Chen already had an incredible guess in his mind. 

The short-haired girl’s eyes didn’t move as she intently flipped through the books, even pulling her own hair in irritation. 

Xiao Chen walked to her step by step, finally being able to discern the girl’s face under the faint light——it was the leader of the group of girls he had met earlier!

What was going on?

His heart beat faster, and he felt that this situation was unimaginable.

He hadn’t known the girl for a long time, but he could tell that her temperament was very firm. She was logical and had her own ideas. Xiao Chen found it hard to believe that someone like her would bully Xu Sheng. How could she be a sinner?

Was he thinking in the wrong direction?

What crime did the sinner commit?

Could the shadow be lying to him? No, that was impossible. Xiao Chen swiftly rejected this thought. The other had assisted him many times before, so he deeply trusted that Mr. Shadow would not deceive him.

It was at this moment that the broadcast continued. {It was you who tricked him here, remember? Keke.} This time the broadcast wasn’t the same as the previous two. Those were spoken by a mechanical male voice, but now it was evidently a normal youth’s. This new voice dragged out each word, and its pitch was slightly low. It was as if the speaker had covered their mouth and nose, leading people to involuntarily shiver when they listened.

Xiao Chen recalled the dream he had before, and this voice…

Was it Xu Sheng?

Everyone present had clearly heard the broadcast, and they all stiffened. In an instant, the library was terribly quiet.

Because Xiao Chen was so close to the short-haired girl, he distinctly noticed that her fingers tightened around the book in her hand, and that she couldn’t stop shaking. Soon, her legs unexpectedly softened, and she directly knelt on the ground.

“Yang Jie, is it you?!” The curly-haired girl who had screamed earlier was nearby. She quickly reacted and moved towards the short-haired girl, her face ferocious. Her harsh voice interrupted the surrounding silence.

Yang Jie’s expression collapsed. “No, it’s not me!”

“It’s not you? Within our sisters, who doesn’t know that you used Xiao Chen’s name to lure Xu Sheng to the library!” The curly-haired girl aggressively stepped forward to grab the collar of Yang Jie’s uniform. 

Xiao Chen was stunned.

What did they mean, his name?

Yang Jie staggered after her collar was pulled, and she couldn’t help but glance at Xiao Chen in shame.

The curly-haired girl sneered. “You still don’t want to admit it? Don’t you like Senior Xiao Chen? When you heard that Xu Sheng liked Senior Xiao Chen too, you couldn’t hold back, right? Bai Qiaoqiao told you to bring Xu Sheng to the library, and didn’t you do it?”

“I’m not, I didn’t!” Yang Jie choked out as she sat paralyzed on the ground. 

“It still wasn’t you? You used Xiao Chen’s name to schedule a meeting with Xu Sheng, and then you humiliated him in the library!” Then Wang Tong led people to drag Xu Sheng to the bathroom to take photos. 

But the curly-haired girl didn’t say this last sentence. 

“It was actually her?” 

“It couldn’t be, wasn’t she the one who especially couldn’t bear to see other people bully Xu Sheng?”

“Who knows, knowing people only means knowing faces, not knowing hearts.”

The murmuring began again, and a few people even sneaked a peek at Wang Tong’s expression. After all, the one who bullied Xu Sheng in the bathroom was him.

Half of the people in the library even concluded that the next one had to be Wang Tong!

Some of them were secretly relieved. Fortunately, they hadn’t bullied Xu Sheng. But they forgot that they had stood by with cold eyes, resulting in Xu Sheng choosing to commit suicide. How could Xu Sheng spare them?

Wang Tong’s face was extremely ugly, but he rapidly recovered. Without any explanation, he walked forward and seized Yang Jie’s arm, loudly yelling, “Tie her up!”

Yang Jie’s eyes widened. She wanted to break free from Wang Tong’s hand, but was caught by the curly-haired girl. When everyone saw the situation, they went to help with barely any hesitation. 

“Don’t! Don’t! Let me go!” Yang Jie started to scream like she was a maniac. She opened her mouth and madly bit Wang Tong’s hand. Along with using both her hands and feet, her struggle was showing some success. 

After Wang Tong was bitten, he immediately threw away Yang Jie. His eyes were burning with fire as he slapped her face. 

Yang Jie was directly flung to the ground from the force.

Xiao Chen was astonished by the scene in front of him. He was the only one still staring blankly at the scene, but he recovered shortly. Just as he was going to go save Yang Jie, he was tightly hugged by a pair of hands and pulled into an embrace. 

Was it that Mr. Shadow?

Before Xiao Chen could act, he sensed Mr. Shadow move close to his ear. The other’s teeth gently grazed Xiao Chen’s earlobe. “Don’t go. Death here is not a real death.”

What did that mean?

Was this not the Otherworld?

Wait.

He suddenly thought of a question. Why didn’t the people here need to drink water, eat, or go to the bathroom, even though they had been staying here for so long?

And he had obviously entered the world at noon, so why was it already night? Furthermore, the others had supposedly been here for a day and a night!

If even their deaths weren’t real, then where would this really be?

Xiao Chen swallowed. He felt that all of this was a bit absurd. A guess was gradually forming in his mind. 

The answer was certain.

This was a dream!

It wasn’t an actuality!

Perhaps, Xu Sheng didn’t want them to die! Instead, he opted to torture their minds, so that they would also experience the suffering of their own death!

The kind of suffering that was disgusted, hurt, and watched coldly by everybody.

When the students woke up, no one would be able to forget everything that happened in the dream. At that time, what sort of terrifying scene would be the reunion of these people in reality?

Would they go insane? Would they seek revenge because of their resentment from being killed by someone else in the dream? Or, would they choose to commit suicide because of their traumatizing experience? Would they never be able to distinguish between reality and dreams from then?

Therefore, everyone had to be killed by a companion, not by other things. Only that sort of betrayal would lead to more despair. 

Xiao Chen frowned and was shocked by his own ideas.

But.

So what if he knew it was a dream? Would he be able to safely observe as a bystander?

Yang Jie had already been bound, and something had been stuffed in her mouth. She cried, tears flowing down her cheeks without pause. She squirmed in desperation, wishing to escape, but was powerless. 

Xiao Chen saw that the faces of the people around her were numb to the point of indifference, and his heart cooled.

How could they be so ruthless?

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Xiao Chen rushed up to protect Yang Jie with his entire body. “Wait, you guys stop!”

When Yang Jie saw him coming, her anguish turned to hope. She looked at Xiao Chen like she had been redeemed by God. 

Wang Tong pursed his lips and said icily, “Step aside, this has nothing to do with you!”

Before Xiao Chen was able to respond, their surroundings were plunged into darkness. There was no light at all, so it was pitch black. 

“Frick me, what’s the matter?”

“Why is it so dark? It couldn’t be that the monsters have arrived, right?”

“AHHHHHHHHH!”

Everybody abruptly scattered. Some leaned against the walls and some clutched their companions, terrified. 

Xiao Chen was frozen in place. But it was because he sensed that his body was being caressed by someone again.

This feeling was very intense, and he couldn’t see anything else in the dark. But this person didn’t do too much, and only massaged his waist before letting go.

The moonlight from outside the window shone through once more, and the weak lighting was restored.

Yang Jie had already lost her life. Her eyes were closed, and blood pooled out beneath her.

Xiao Chen involuntarily shuddered. 

{Congratulations to all the players who successfully found the sinner!} The mechanical broadcast sounded again.

All the people noticed it and cheered. They sighed deeply in relief, and didn’t even spare half a glance towards the dead Yang Jie.

Completely disregarding their former friendship.

The curly-haired girl merely took an emotionless glimpse at Yang Jie’s body. She found a spot to sit down, planning to rest.

Wang Tong’s gaze was complicated as he stared at Xiao Chen, but he quietly walked to the side. The others followed him and scrambled away, until Xiao Chen was the only one left.

Xiao Chen didn’t move.

He heard someone say to him, “As you wished, she died without any pain. She has woken up from her dream.”

The Bible says, "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door.”

The black shadow stood there indifferently, watching the farce. Only when his sight landed on Xiao Chen did it soften. 

Senior.

Everything will be as you wish.

You are my god. 



 Xiao Chen exhaled deeply, sullenly bypassing the crowd as he shifted towards the door. 

No one blocked him, and there wouldn’t be anyone who would do so.

In the tranquil night, the Boston ivy eagerly grew all over the walls, as if it thought no one would notice it if it didn’t make any sound. However, it wasn’t the common yellow-green color, but rather a black and purple berry color. It blended into the night, so people couldn’t see it clearly.

The entire library building was enveloped in the Boston ivy. It passed through the windowsill and slowly invaded the room. There was so much that it was terrifying. 

At the same time, white fog spread over the entire campus. 

Xiao Chen headed towards the main gate of the library building. Surprisingly, the lights in the building, which didn’t have power, would suddenly work as he walked by. Basically, wherever he went, they would automatically turn on. The instant he left, the area would return to darkness, like the lights were only voice-activated.

Xiao Chen pursed his lips.

Actually, he already had the answer in his heart.

The shadow under his feet split into two. The new shadow slowly condensed into a solid form, with vague facial features and a body shape.

Xiao Chen dipped his head and could see the black shadow cuddling his waist. If it was someone who had a weak mind, they would probably be so scared that they would faint.

Xiao Chen directly turned around to face the black shadow. The surrounding lights were on, so he could clearly see the other’s appearance. 

The facial features of the shadow were natural and three-dimensional, but Xiao Chen felt that there was a mist in front of him that wouldn’t let him see the details or remember anything. 

“You.” He directly touched the shadow’s face, attentively and seriously studying it. He could sense that he was holding something, but there was no temperature to it. 

The black shadow didn’t speak, and let Xiao Chen’s hand move up and down on his face.

“You are Xu Sheng, right?” Xiao Chen’s voice was normal, but if one paid close attention, there would be a tension that was difficult to describe.

The mist covering Xiao Chen’s eyes dissipated, and the shadow’s original looks were exposed to the air.

“Yes.”

Xiao Chen didn’t expect the other party to reply so straightforwardly. He remained blankly in place, his hand slipping from the black shadow’s face back to his side. 

Without making any noise, the two stood like this foolishly, neither uttering a word.

Xiao Chen didn’t know what to say, and Xu Sheng was waiting for the other to do so.

“I’m sorry.” Xiao Chen stiffly opened his mouth, lowering his head. His fingers tightly clutched Xu Sheng’s shoulders.

If it weren’t for him, Xu Sheng wouldn’t have died.

The black shadow loosened his grip on Xiao Chen’s waist, using his own hands to gently grab Xiao Chen’s. He placed them in his palms, and then squatted down in a semi-kneeling posture, his head leaning against Xiao Chen’s stomach. 

It was as pious as paying respects to a god. 

Xiao Chen heard him whisper this.

“In this world, only you should not say sorry to me.”

You are my sole salvation.

Gao Xuhan calmed down and looked at Yang Jie’s distant body in a daze. 

She had a bold idea. Since the movie ended after everyone died, then did that mean that she could go home after that happened? 

The people around her sat on the ground expressionlessly. They didn’t even dare to close their eyes. Even if they needed to pinch themselves, they would stay awake.

After all, during the night, it wouldn’t be safe. 

Gao Xuhan took out a small knife she had stumbled upon in the library, squeezing it intensely. 

She didn’t want to die, and she couldn’t die.

But she didn’t notice that the curly-haired girl, who had been the first to find her in the library and was now sitting across from her, was staring at her without even blinking. The girl had been in the same position for three whole minutes. 

A faint light came by. The pupils of the curly-haired girl carried hints of a bloody color, and when she raised the corners of her mouth, sharp fangs appeared. This was just like a vampire waiting for an opportunity to hunt.

Her sight drifted from Gao Xuhan to Yang Jie’s body, which had already lost temperature.

She strongly inhaled, licking her teeth with the tip of her tongue. She gasped, as if she was unexpectedly fascinated.

A random girl was startled by the curly-haired girl’s abrupt actions, and she couldn’t help but scoot backwards to the wall. At this exact moment, the curly-haired girl, Zhou Ping, steadily raised her head, tilting it so that her curls were thrown behind. 

Her eyes were fully displayed. Before the random girl could do anything, her shoulder had been savagely bitten by Zhou Ping. 

“AHHHHHHHHHH!” Her screams frightened the drowsy people nearby.

“Save me, save me!!! Save me quickly!!” The girl used both her hands and feet to try and get rid of Zhou Ping, pulling the other’s hair. But Zhou Ping seemed to have lost awareness, and merely continued to enjoy sucking the girl’s fresh blood. The struggling hands appeared to disturb her meal and irritate her, so Zhou Ping directly seized the girl’s neck to stop her.

Perhaps she was too forceful, because the other actually ceased breathing. 

But Zhou Ping was very happy, and resumed eating. The speed at which she sucked blood was astonishing. 

Within the time it took to burn incense, the random girl had turned into a dried corpse before everyone’s sight. 

Then, Zhou Ping tossed the body away and rubbed her belly.

Still hungry…

She lifted her head and greedily examined the people in the library.

“AHHHHHHHHH!!”

“Save our lives!”

“AHHHHHHHHH!!!”

Xu Sheng’s eyes suddenly opened. In his arms, he held Xiao Chen, who had fallen asleep. 

And their surroundings began to reassemble, from an ordinary classroom to a bedroom. If Xiao Chen had woken up, he would have discovered that it was similar to his own bedroom. 

Xu Sheng carefully covered him with a blanket, before his own body gradually became insubstantial, turning into black mist. Only a vaguely human figure remained. 

“The fifth.” Xu Sheng didn’t know what he had felt, and started to part his lips.

The Bible says that there are seven things that God hates: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies, and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.

And the 13th-century Dominican priest St. Thomas Aquinas cited seven capital vices: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust.

Bai Qiaoqiao’s pride and prejudice ruined Xu Sheng, Liu Chunming’s sloth led him to ignore his students’ bullying, and Yang Jie’s envy pushed Xu Sheng into the abyss. 

Everyone has committed one of the seven deadly sins!

“Gluttony has begun to smoke.” Xu Sheng curved the corner of his mouth.

The nightmare has also started.

Binge eating is an evil desire that will bite back. 



 “Let me go, let me go! Save me!!”

The boy who had been caught by Zhou Ping struggled frantically, but his strength became nothing when his neck was bitten. His whole person was numbly still.

When Zhou Ping had started to go crazy, everyone had scrambled towards the library’s door. But the door that was obviously open when they came was actually locked, and even the windows were blocked by a mysterious plant. They couldn’t pull it away no matter what.

All of them were trapped in the library.

“AHHHHHHH!!”

Zhou Ping shook her head and coldly looked at this scene. In the dark, her scarlet eyes almost seemed to glow. She flared her nostrils, and appeared to be attracted by something. Then, she began to lurch towards Wang Tong, step by step.

Wang Tong swallowed his saliva, and swiftly grabbed a library chair next to him, repeatedly smashing Zhou Ping’s head.

“Swell.” There was a strange and loud noise, and after another of bones cracking, Zhou Ping actually responded by collapsing. But before the students could sigh in relief, she rapidly stood up again. Like a corpse, she swayed unsteadily in a hunched posture. Sounds of gurgling spit leaked from her throat. 

At this time, Zhou Ping’s belly was alarmingly large, resembling a rubber ball. It was simply bulging, and the size of a five months pregnant woman.

Wang Tong’s insides twisted. He immediately snatched a girl near him, and to her disbelief, pushed her towards Zhou Ping’s body. 

Zhou Ping stopped and grasped the girl. She started to suck blood while letting out content slurps, but her speed was noticeably much slower now. Before she was done, her belly had swelled to a terrifying degree. 

The surroundings were eerily quiet.

“Splash.” Following a loud noise, some liquid splattered onto all the people’s faces and bodies.

Wang Tong was the closest, so the fresh blood even went into his eyes.

“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”

Zhou Ping had exploded like a pierced balloon!

Xiao Chen abruptly sat up, clutching his chest. He didn’t know when he had fallen asleep! 

As he looked around, his hands trembled. This was his own room!

He returned?

What about Xu Sheng? What about those people?

Xiao Chen violently lifted the blanket covering him, intending to go wear his shoes. 

Suddenly, two green vines stretched out from under his bed like flexible rubber bands. One enthusiastically used its tip to hook Xiao Chen’s right shoe, and the other fixed his foot in the correct position. With this cooperation, the shoe was easily put on Xiao Chen’s foot.

Until both shoes were worn, Xiao Chen maintained a dumbfounded expression.

The vine was not satisfied with just this. A towel emerged out of nowhere, and Xiao Chen’s face was carefully wiped. The actions were gentle, but Xiao Chen still felt a bit itchy, and his ears burned. 

He curled up, slightly resisting.

Instantly, the vine seemed to wither. The grip on Xiao Chen was loosened as it pitifully and helplessly moved to the side. Even its leaves drooped as if they had lost vitality. 

Xiao Chen inexplicably felt that the vine was cute, so he poked a leaf. The lucky leaf he touched acted like mimosa pudica, shyly wrapping around Xiao Chen’s finger.

Xiao Chen silently smiled, thinking of something as he got up from bed and walked to the door.

The vine didn’t stop him, and instead rubbed Xiao Chen’s neck like a little hamster that had stolen some food to eat. Before Xiao Chen could react, it had actually turned into a vague black shadow. Taking advantage of the situation, the shadow printed a kiss on Xiao Chen’s lips, and then speedily dispersed, leaving the other with no chance to reject. 

Xiao Chen was speechless as he opened the door. 

As he expected, he was still in the dream Xu Sheng had weaved. 

Observing the familiar hallway, he confirmed his own coordinates. This was actually his own classroom!

When he peeked behind himself, the bedroom he had just slept in had already changed back into the classroom. Everything was as usual, with nothing different. 

And the sky showed that it was already dawn.

When Xiao Chen recalled the people in first year’s Class 4, he couldn’t help but frown.

“Crunch.” There was the sound of leaves being stepped on.

Xiao Chen immediately turned around.

He only saw a black-haired girl in a uniform, who had appeared behind him at an unknown time. Xiao Chen was shocked, as he quickly recognized the girl as the one who was discovered by the others when he went to the library yesterday. He particularly remembered that she had stared at him with a scared look in her eyes. This made him have a rather deep impression of her. “It’s you? Do you have something to say to me?”

Gao Xuhan flinched and glanced at Xiao Chen. She tightly clutched the small knife in her hand, thoughts overflowing in her mind.

In the movie, Xiao Chen was the last to die, and the previous owner of her body was the only one who survived in the entire school. The original Gao Xuhan had a mild temperament, and was especially invisible to others. Within all the horror movies the current Gao Xuhan had watched, this heroine was the one who seemed the least like a heroine.

Throughout the film, she had stayed with the main group to escape.

But after the present Gao Xuhan had gone through so many things, she no longer believed in this plot! Everything that had occurred was different from the movie!

No Zhou Qingqing! Not even Li Ni! Merely the students of Class 4 and Xiao Chen had been dragged into this world. 

The memories she had inherited from the real Gao Xuhan were too simple. That girl only monotonously studied, and had no friends. This kind of boring life completely couldn’t help at all!

But in those memories, the original owner of Gao Xuhan’s body really did have a few interactions with Xu Sheng.

She already had no other choice. She had to believe that Xu Sheng liked her, and all she could do was kill everyone!

She wanted to live, and she didn’t want to die!

Yesterday, she had watched with wide eyes as many familiar faces around her died. It had happened in front of her, and she herself had also been threatened with the prospect of death! 

The students clearly didn’t hold much trust, but it was unimaginable that they had the sort of relationship with each other where they would easily send someone else to their demise just to save themselves!

Gao Xuhan found it ridiculous.

After being here for two days, she knew that it was safe during the day, and there wouldn’t be any monsters. She decided to separate from the main group to search for a life-saving tool in order to assist her in the long-term. Unexpectedly, she noticed Xiao Chen.

There were several common tropes in horror films, and one of them was——as long as someone was alone, they had to die!

She had assumed that Xiao Chen had already been brutally murdered by Xu Sheng. But she didn’t think that he was still alive!

This was something that was hard to believe!

She was gambling, gambling that Xiao Chen was the key to her return home.

She began to weigh the pros and cons in her mind, before finally saying, “Senior Xiao Chen, can I go with you?”

Xiao Chen was reluctant inside, but he was too embarrassed to refuse her. When he was about to agree, he suddenly discovered that his mouth had been covered by something. Someone moved close to his ear, firmly saying, “Not allowed.”

Xiao Chen blushed in shame. He secretly thought, wow, this possessiveness is really too strong!

“Sorry, I prefer to be alone.” Xiao Chen could only decline Gao Xuhan’s request in this manner.

Gao Xuhan pursed her lips, and was a little unwilling to give up. She clasped the knife in her hand and pursued in asking, “Where did Senior go yesterday? There was an accident in the library last night, but fortunately, Senior is safe and sound.”

Xiao Chen didn’t fall for her sweet words. When he saw Yang Jie dying, he realized the true colors of the group. But he still politely replied, “I was a bit dizzy from fear, so I found a place to hide by myself.” Xiao Chen grasped the keywords in Gao Xuhan’s words, so he promptly asked, “What happened after I left yesterday?”

Gao Xuhan was somewhat suspicious, but she did not rush to question him. Every time she thought of the scene last night, she was sickened, but she still answered honestly. “Last night, a girl suddenly went mad and started to suck people’s blood. Quite a few people died before the girl burst from eating too much!”

The ancient text, “Classic of Mountains and Seas”, introduced it as one of the Four Perils, with the face of a human and the body of a sheep. Its eyes were under its armpits, and it had the teeth of tigers as claws for its human hands. Though it had both a large head and mouth, it had overeaten so much that it had suffocated to death. 

However, in all ancient Chinese criminal laws, starvation was never used as a punishment, unlike in Persia and Europe. 

In Muslim teachings, there were even more cases of punishment by starvation——because the prisoner committed the crime of lying.

Xiao Chen’s eyelids jumped. The first thing that had come to mind was Taotie.

“Girl? Was it the girl with curly hair?” For some reason, Xiao Chen’s initial guess was her. 

Gao Xuhan was surprised, and her eyes held unclear emotions. “Yes.”



 Xiao Chen was shocked in his heart.

Actually, when he had seen the curly-haired girl push the blame onto Yang Jie last night, he had already felt that something was off. But he couldn’t put his finger on exactly what it was. 

At least, he didn’t believe that the curly-haired girl would be tortured for nothing. 

He could see that in this dream woven by Xu Sheng, there were some people purposefully chosen to have a gruesome demise. Other people’s deaths were more similar to adding fuel to the fire, as there wasn’t much punishment involved in the process. Those who were due for punishment were Bai Qiaoqiao, Yang Jie, and that curly-haired girl. 

Xiao Chen was sure of one thing, which was that Bai Qiaoqiao was really dead. But when everyone else was killed, they would wake up from the dream alive. 

Xiao Chen didn’t wish to stop Xu Sheng’s revenge. He wasn’t the Holy Mother, and furthermore, he didn’t believe that this group of students was innocent. 

Moreover, in this world, death did not mean death in reality. 

“Senior Xiao Chen, please let me go with you.” Gao Xuhan saw his contemplative face and promptly wanted to walk forward and tug on the other’s clothes. But when she had just barely touched them, she experienced a painful electric shock. She was so alarmed that she hastily retrieved her hand.

Xiao Chen immediately retreated a few steps. “Are you okay?”

Gao Xuhan swallowed her saliva, and her legs softened a little. In her eyes, everything around her had gone through earthshaking changes. 

The originally clear weather was suddenly bathed in darkness, and the surrounding camphor trees were the color of black charcoal, like they had been burnt in a fire. Even the bright sun was now scarlet.

Xiao Chen’s face had transformed into meat paste, and his whole body was indistinct. White bone was exposed through his torn flesh, as if he had been skinned alive.

“AHHHHH!” Gao Xuhan was frightened into madness, and she almost fell to the ground. She violently turned around and bolted, leaving Xiao Chen standing in place, dumbfounded as he watched her.

Gao Xuhan trembled uncontrollably as she ran for an unknown amount of time. When she was about to collapse from exhaustion, she felt her head being enveloped by something similar to a black shadow. Soon, black mist began to emanate from her body, carrying hints of maliciousness. 

“Want to live longer?” A male voice whispered in her ear, so hoarse that it seemed like its owner’s throat had been damaged. 

“AHHHHHHH!” Gao Xuhan hurriedly backed away, horror evident in her eyes.

“Do you not want to go home? You aren’t someone from this world, right? Keke.” This voice was extremely creepy, low, indifferent and cold, and echoed. 

Gao Xuhan was stunned, and her mouth parted reflexively. She almost let out a sound, but she blocked her mouth in time when she heard the voice icily warn, “Don’t talk if you don’t want to die.” 

“Want to live?”

Gao Xuhan’s tears flowed down her cheeks as she covered her nose and mouth. She nodded fiercely, fearing that the other party would take back his words. 

“Then listen to me.” The voice had a somewhat persuading tone, and was very light.

“I’ll give you one chance.” The voice paused, before saying with a sneer, “Hurry to the gym within half an hour, and open the iron box at the center. Afterwards, you will be allowed to escape.”

Gao Xuhan’s snot was smeared all over her face as she nodded vigorously. She waited until the pressure on her had dispersed, before slumping on the ground as if she had just been freed from chains.

Ah.

Ever heard of Pandora’s Box?

When the lid was taken off that magic box, greed, hypocrisy, slander, jealousy, suffering, and death were released. And once the magic box was opened, it could never be closed.

Xiao Chen suspiciously looked at Gao Xuhan’s back view. He paused, dipping his head to examine his arm. He didn’t know why the other party was so aggressive. 

But he didn’t take this matter too seriously. Instead, he paid more attention to what she had told him. Xiao Chen pondered for a moment, thinking that the curly-haired girl’s cause of death was really puzzling. Eventually, he resolutely decided to return to the library. 

He trusted Xu Sheng quite a bit, and he knew that the other would not harm him.

From the beginning, this dream was meant to punish the sinners who had hurt Xu Sheng. Xiao Chen wasn’t included. At the start, he was the one who had chosen to enter the dream.

Among those who were involved, Bai Qiaoqiao and Wang Tong were the masterminds, Yang Jie was a partner, and the others were bystanders who helped, so what role did the curly-haired girl play?

Wait, wrong.

Xiao Chen was cold inside for a while.

These people weren’t the only ones who killed Xu Sheng!

There was also the man who lived near Xu Sheng’s home. Xu Sheng had loudly begged him for assistance before his death. The man had seen him, but he did not save him!

Since coming into this dream, Xiao Chen hadn’t seen anyone other than the students in Class 4! If Xu Sheng really wanted revenge, how could he let that man go?

Was the man already dead?

Or did someone here have a close relationship with him?

Xiao Chen swallowed his saliva. His fingers squeezed together unconsciously, and he stood unsteadily.

He was very eager to know the truth!

Why would Yang Jie become an accomplice in Xu Sheng’s death? What really happened that day? What else didn’t he know?

The black shadow under Xiao Chen’s feet appeared to have sensed his uneasiness, and instantly gained solidity. 

But this time, it was no longer a vague outline, but a real human form.

Grey pupils were revealed once the thick and heavy glasses were removed, uncovering the face that should have amazed everyone.

Xiao Chen blushed. Not because of something else, but because he was embarrassed to find that after Xu Sheng had transformed, he was actually wearing the same set of clothes as himself! They both had jeans, a white cotton T-shirt, and even the patterns on their clothes were identical!

Wasn’t this just like a couple?

But the Xu Sheng in front of him had changed dramatically from the Xu Sheng in his memory. Now, his facial features were tougher, he had gained many centimeters in height, and he had matured noticeably. He was more like a man, not a student.

“You.” Before Xiao Chen could finish his words, he was safely cuddled in Xu Sheng’s embrace. “Senior!”

I really want to keep you in my arms like this, forever and ever, so that even the end of life cannot separate us!

Xiao Chen was startled, and he subconsciously hugged Xu Sheng’s head, gently stroking the other’s fluffy hair.

Xu Sheng silently raised the corner of his mouth as his head rested on Xiao Chen’s shoulder. 

The Bible says: Do not arouse or awaken the one I love, until he pleases.

And Shakespeare once said: The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.

“You.” Xiao Chen looked at him dryly. “What did you go through that day?”

Xu Sheng’s grin involuntarily straightened into a thin line. His expression cooled as his eyes narrowed. But in the next second, his face regained its tenderness. He held Xiao Chen’s waist, lovingly saying, “Close your eyes.”

Everything is as you wish.



 ‘Thank you for the gifts you sent. I like them very much. Today, let’s meet in the library after school. I will be waiting for you at the spot nearest to the leftmost wall on the second floor. ——Xiao Chen’

The boy’s body was trembling, and the hand holding the note was even more unstable. His head was lowered, and the thick bangs and glasses hid his expression. 

Xiao Chen was standing at his own desk, and was baffled by this sudden scene. When he saw clearly who was in front of him, he couldn’t help but widen his eyes. He walked for a few steps around the boy, until he noticed the words on the note. He squeezed his hand tightly.

As the boy fell into contemplation, there was a short-haired girl standing at the back door of the classroom with a cold face. She observed the boy’s actions with her eyes narrowed in indifference, and even some viciousness. Xiao Chen could almost recognize her at first glance——it was Yang Jie.

He involuntarily held his breath, his heartbeat speeding up. 

Was this Xu Sheng’s memory?

Xiao Chen watched the boy gently hold the note like it was a treasure, as if he was afraid that there would be any creases. He pulled out a thick blue notebook from his desk and carefully smoothed out the note he had received, before tucking it inside.

Every move expressed utmost joy.

The boy patted his own clothes, worried that there might be dust. He even tied his shoelaces several times, knot over knot, to ensure that he wouldn’t accidentally trip. In this way, he was finally satisfied. 

He shyly took out a gift box from his desk, a bit excited. Then, he walked out the door, leaning against the wall timidly. 

When Yang Jie saw him get up, she immediately withdrew her gaze and pretended to know nothing as she returned to her seat. 

But the other students raised their heads simultaneously, laughing in ridicule as they observed him.

Xiao Chen followed the boy, his footsteps light. He clearly didn’t feel hot, yet his forehead was mysteriously coated in cold sweat. With his eyes wide, he could only watch the boy skillfully evade crowded areas and pass through the teaching building, taking a long detour. Under everyone’s strange looks, he entered the library. 

It was that kind of look, the one that contained undisguised revulsion and loathing. For a moment, Xiao Chen almost felt like he was Xu Sheng, even though he understood that these people weren’t focused on himself. But when their cruelty swept over him, he couldn’t help but get chills.

The boy appeared as if he didn’t realize others’ maliciousness. He happily skipped up to the library’s second floor and slowly headed towards the leftmost wall. He wanted to jump in joy, but at the same time, he nervously rubbed his hands together. Soon, he steadily sat down.

The clock hanging on the wall made Xiao Chen guess that school was already over.

Minutes and seconds flowed by as the boy patiently waited in place. Even after the occasional chattering in the library had turned into total silence, he still soundlessly remained there, looking forward to meeting that person. 

However, Xiao Chen’s spirits sank lower and lower as time passed. He sat across from the boy, examining him closely as the other gradually revealed his restlessness. Xiao Chen’s heart tightened.

“Xu Sheng, don’t wait anymore, he won’t come.” His voice was hoarse and tearful, but the boy couldn’t hear him, much less answer him. He knew that the boy couldn’t see him either.

Xiao Chen listened to the ticking of the clock and slightly shook. He had already guessed what Xu Sheng was going to experience next. 

In the distance, footsteps began to approach the two. Xiao Chen and Xu Sheng turned towards the sound’s source together. The boy was elated, but he restrained himself. 

But Xiao Chen’s breathing became rapid, and his hands started to tremble.

“Holy cow, Xu Sheng really came?”

“He’s actually gay?”

“So nasty!”

“Just him? He dares to have delusions of being with Senior Xiao Chen? That’s so ridiculous! He should just piss on the ground and look at his own reflection!”

Xiao Chen’s face was pale. At first glance, he noticed Yellow Hair, also known as Wang Tong, standing in front of him. 

Xu Sheng froze, and his lips began to quiver. 

Xiao Chen wanted to lead him away, but his hand went through the other’s arm. 

What frightened him even more was that he discovered he couldn’t move the rest of his body, and he was fixed to his chair.

“Xu Sheng, quickly run! Quickly run!!” He shouted distressingly, sweating all over. But no one perceived his presence. 

His lucky phoenix eyes were filled with tears, and his voice was choked as he saw Xu Sheng being dragged away by a group of people. He was helpless to prevent it from happening. 

His surroundings started to twist, and a black shadow quietly emerged from behind him. A pair of hands reached to wipe away the tears trailing from his eyes. 

The black shadow secretly sighed, adjusting himself so that Xiao Chen was comfortably nestled in his embrace. Ultimately, he was still unwilling to let Senior view his most embarrassing moments.

The environment transformed again, this time into a long hallway.

Xiao Chen covered his nose and mouth and almost cried out.

This was the scene from the dream he had before. 

No, it was different. 

With a click, the door opened. The curly-haired girl crossed her arms across her chest and stood beside the door.

“Dad, what are you doing? Just ignore him and leave him there. It’s so noisy!” The curly-haired girl rolled her eyes, yelling loudly at the man taking the photos. 

The man stuffed his phone back into his pocket. He didn’t forget to vehemently kick the boy one last time before replying, “Coming, coming!”

He turned around, never looking back as he closed the door. 

Xiao Chen’s heart fully cooled. 

{Congratulations to player Gao Xuhan for resetting the rules of the game and obtaining a permanent escape quota.} The broadcast sounded once more. {Pandora’s magic box has been opened, and the demons within the people in the game have been released. Through a lottery, the final player of the previous round was chosen. The KING of this round is Wang Tong.}

{Next, he will be the one…} The broadcast paused. It was obviously a mechanical voice, but it made people stiffen with chills. {…to decide whether you live or die.}

“What does this mean?”

“What happened?”

“What KING, why have the rules of the game changed again?”

“Gao Xuhan?! What did she do? Why her?”

After listening to the broadcast, the surroundings erupted in scattered discussions. Everyone was stunned, their sights falling onto Wang Tong. Each carried hints of jealousy and hatred that were hard to conceal. 

Why him?

Wasn’t he the one who drove Xu Sheng to suicide?

But those remarks rapidly disappeared. After all, the broadcast had said that Wang Tong controlled the lives of everyone present! With this, no one dared to offend him.

Wang Tong’s eyes widened and he pursed his lips, feeling ecstatic inside. Ever since he arrived in this place, he had been endlessly anxious in his heart. He was the mastermind behind Xu Sheng’s death, so he understood that the other would never let him go!

Now that he had a chance to survive, how could Wang Tong not be exhilarated?

But what did the broadcast mean when it said that he would determine the students’ life and death?

At the same time, the Boston ivy that had completely enveloped the library building became denser and denser. It had even intertwined with numerous earth-colored vines, clustering together as it advanced through the windows. Some vines had crawled up to the doorway, and in an instant, countless of them slowly crept in like snakes. 

“Frick me, what is that?”

“AHHHHHHH! So disgusting! Let me go!”

“Go away!! Go away!! Save me!”

“Wuwuwuwu!!!”

It was as if the vines had been bestowed life, selectively binding people in the library. The vines trapped them firmly, and neither a stick nor a knife could do anything.

Why was it said that the vines were selective?

Shockingly, an innumerable amount of them had accurately bypassed Wang Tong. Within a minute, everyone was bound by them, and only Wang Tong remained in place without any harm. 

A chill ran down Wang Tong’s spine, and he exhaled. 

Suddenly, the sky outside shifted from day to night. Where the sun once was, there was now a scarlet moon, carrying bloodthirsty mystery.

The broadcast turned on. {KING, have you seen these revolting bugs?}

“Wuwu!!”

“Hmmmm!!!”

{Their life and death is currently in your hands! Let’s play a game! The name is…} The broadcast’s voice was as ruthless and indifferent as the Devil’s. {…And Then There Were None!}

{There are still twelve bugs here, so let’s play three rounds.} There was no fluctuation in the broadcast’s voice, but for some reason, it seemed menacing to the people present. {As long as you succeed, you can bring them and leave.}

{But the choice is all yours. If you don’t wish to play, you can depart right now. Then, however, all these bugs will die immediately!} The broadcast paused.

{Skinning, disembowelment, lingchi, the Five Punishments, being boiled alive, and being buried alive…….} With its mechanical voice, the broadcast laughed. {Which one do you like?}

“Wuwuwu!!!!!”

“AHwuwu!!”

“Hmmmwuwuwu!!!”

Help me!!!

Wang Tong’s lips were pale, and his sight blurred. His body was shaking. He observed as the people around him painfully and intently stared at his face, their noses running and tears streaming. Eventually, Wang Tong took a deep breath, weakly murmuring, “Okay, I’ll play!”

{Congratulations to player Wang Tong for activating punishment mode. The first round is dripping sulfuric acid!} The broadcast sounded again. 

{In front of you, there is a large bottle with sulfuric acid in it.} The broadcast was interrupted by the noise of creaking bones. {If you place your right hand inside for thirty seconds, then the first round will be cleared.}

So,

are you willing?



 Wang Tong squeezed his hands tightly, and all the muscles in his body slightly spasmed. Everyone concentrated on him, their eyes begging him for help and filled with a mix of horror, fear, despair, and pain. 

Wang Tong started to shake. He walked until he was in front of the bottle of sulfuric acid. The liquid was colorless, transparent, as well as oily. Wang Tong carefully inserted his index finger inside, tentatively touching the edge of the bottle. But before he actually made contact with the liquid, he broke down and retrieved his hand. He was originally a cold-blooded person, so how could he be willing to wrong himself for the sake of others? He gritted his teeth. “I can’t do it.”

“Wuwuwu!!”

“!!!!!”

All the people bound by the vines began to struggle fiercely, their eyes bulging in extreme anger.

I don’t want to die!!

The broadcast chuckled in a sort of creepy tone. {It seems that everyone has their own opinion!}

{Since this is the case, I can give you all another chance!} It let out a raspy rubbing sound.

At the same time, the vines started to loosen at a pitifully slow speed, releasing those that were trapped. 

{As long as you all put his hand in the sulfuric acid, this round will count as a win!} Wang Tong’s eyes widened, and his heart leapt. He was planning to run, but before he could even take one step, a boy rushed ahead and grabbed his left arm. He was horrified. That boy was actually his most obedient brother!

Wang Tong practiced Taekwondo, and he kicked that boy away with one sweep of his leg.

But in the next second, his right leg was seized by another boy. Without waiting for him to do anything else, a purple-haired girl came up and bashed him with a chair.

“Bam!” There was a loud noise.

Wang Tong’s stance was unstable, and after being hit in the back, he directly fell onto the floor. He had heard the subtle sound of his bone fracturing when the chair smashed into him. 

“AHHH!” He bared his teeth in agony.

Other people saw the situation and glanced around. Immediately, they stepped forward without hesitation, intending to restrain Wang Tong’s flailing arms and legs. 

Wang Tong was in so much pain that he was covered in cold sweat. He could barely move, much less fight back! His right hand supported his waist as he curled up on the ground.

“Quick! Bring the bottle here!” a boy in the crowd shouted. Wang Tong endured his suffering and attempted to break free, but his whole body felt like it was falling apart. He couldn’t exert any effort, and there were also five or six people hanging onto his limbs. Even if he wanted to move, he couldn’t! 

“Let go of this father!” Wang Tong used his head to attack the person closest to him. That boy was enraged, and he picked up the same chair to ferociously strike Wang Tong’s head. 

“Thump!” Blood erupted from Wang Tong’s throat, and he felt dizzy. There was a deep wound on his head, similar to a blood-smeared mouth. Wang Tong was like a dying doll as he completely lost his ability to resist. His limbs gradually began to stop twitching, until only his eyeballs could rotate left and right. 

Everyone in his sight had transformed into beasts which couldn’t wait to take a bite of his flesh.

They carried resentment, survival instincts, and a pressing fury.

Xiao Chen was laying in Xu Sheng’s arms, fresh tears still being squeezed out from the corners of his eyes. His hands tightly clung to Xu Sheng’s back.

“At that time, did it hurt?” Xiao Chen’s voice was hoarse and held a faint tremble. 

How could it not hurt?

Being humiliated and slandered by everyone would inflict a torture upon the mind that was far more □□ than anything else. Right before his death, he had suffered the most. He loathed them and cursed them with the most vicious words in the world. When his hatred and resentment ran bone-deep and coursed through his blood, he finally changed into a Li Gui seeking revenge on original sin! 

Xu Sheng gently swept Senior’s bangs away from his face, and then wiped the corners of the other’s eyes. His grey pupils overflowed with obsession. “It wasn’t painful.”

Xiao Chen choked.

He didn’t believe it.

“Senior, can I kiss you?” Xu Sheng raised the corners of his mouth and rested his head on Xiao Chen’s shoulder. He sniffed the other’s unique scent, his eyes blurred in pleasure. That light fragrance had involuntarily stimulated him. 

Xiao Chen didn’t speak. His expression was somewhat listless, and he didn’t reject, but merely slouched in Xu Sheng’s embrace.

Xu Sheng smiled, kissing Senior’s Adam’s apple. His lips slowly moved upwards, kissing Senior’s left ear and licking his earlobe. Xu Sheng could sense the person in his arms quivering because of his actions.

He really liked Senior’s left ear. Even a soft breath could make him tremble, so every time, Xu Sheng would lean over to Senior’s left ear to talk with him. 


As someone approached with the bottle of sulfuric acid, Wang Tong’s eyes frantically darted to and fro, like he was hoping a miracle would emerge out of thin air. However, there were solely the twisted forms of his classmates as they gripped his limbs, slightly anticipating what was to come. But they were forced to do this! After all, Wang Tong would merely lose function in one hand, but everyone else’s lives would be forfeit if he didn’t touch the sulfuric acid! Wang Tong was infuriated, but he could only watch as the boy with a buzz cut, the brother who was usually the most obedient, snatched the bottle and turned around. 

“Wang Tong, you only have yourself to blame!” Buzz Cut said, each word dripping with hatred. Several other people nodded as they positioned Wang Tong’s hand. 

Wang Tong’s eyes widened as reality began to sink in. Despite being struck heavily twice, he was able to somewhat bear the excruciating agony because of his original toughness. He even had the energy to be angry! But he understood that he was about to experience pain far worse. 

Relying on the last of his strength, he fiercely squirmed in an attempt to break free. This proved to be futile, as the others just applied more force to hold him down. 

With one thrust, Wang Tong’s hand was mercilessly shoved into the bottle of sulfuric acid. 

“AHHHHHHHH!!!”

Layers of his tissue and muscle gradually parted, pushing him to the brink of insanity. His skin blackened, burning away as each cell was destroyed. Within seconds, his right hand was so disfigured that it was difficult to recognize. 

This kind of torture revived Wang Tong’s impulses, and his hand started to wildly thrash around. As the sulfuric acid sloshed around, a few drops managed to land outside. 

“Motherf*cker!”

Everyone scrambled away as Buzz Cut threw the bottle at the wall, clutching his own hand with a grim expression. 

Wang Tong, on the other hand, had to endure the most suffering. Now that his limbs were free, he rolled onto his side and howled in anguish, tears involuntarily streaming down his face. He felt like he was close to fainting at any moment, yet there was something keeping him conscious. He had deteriorated to the point that he was numb to everything except the waves and waves of agony. 

With a murderous gaze, Buzz Cut seized a handful of Wang Tong’s hair and tilted the other’s head. Everyone else returned to restrain his arms and legs. Their fury nearly matched that of Buzz Cut’s. 

“Can’t you think from our perspective for once? We’ll be killed if we don’t pass this round of the game!” Buzz Cut roared. All the people surrounding him were increasingly anxious as they waited for the broadcast. Did Wang Tong’s actions cause them to lose the round?

But a contemptuous glint actually appeared in Wang Tong’s eyes when he heard Buzz Cut. He might have even grinned if he wasn’t in so much pain! He wasn’t stupid, and he knew that he was beyond saving. Thus, what he currently wished for the most was to drag his classmates down with him!

“You still want to mock us? Let’s see how you behave when I dig out those eyes of yours!” A random person shouted.

The broadcast abruptly turned on. {Congratulations to the players for winning the first round! There seems to be a very interesting suggestion for the next round. Shouldn’t the KING be punished for his arrogance? If player Wang Tong’s eyes are successfully gouged out by other players, the second round will be cleared!}

The students were stunned. They never thought that the broadcast would go so far! No one was willing to do the deed as they glanced at Wang Tong. A few people even stumbled to the side to retch as they pictured Wang Tong’s face without eyes. They didn’t have the courage to look at him anymore! 

“Stop!! Don’t do it, bast*rds!” Wang Tong hoarsely cried. It was too much! In addition to his ruined hand, Wang Tong couldn’t perceive a single part of his body that didn’t hurt. The hair on his forehead was matted in sweat, and his teeth were clenched so tightly that he was afraid they would crack under the pressure.

There was a period of silence before someone spoke. 

“I don’t want to die,” Buzz Cut said. His words seemed to remind everyone. Suddenly, the idea of digging out Wang Tong’s eyes wasn’t so appalling any more.

Wang Tong aggressively shut his eyes, but he had already given up in his heart. Death would be his sole savior! 

Soon, his left eye was pried open by Buzz Cut. He stared in absolute dread as the fingers descended upon him like the claws of a hungry monster. In one swift motion, his eyeball was pulled out!

“AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!”

Wang Tong convulsed, foam frothing from the corners of his mouth. Blood gushed out from beneath his sagging eyelid, mixing with his tears. Eventually, his movement ceased. If he wasn’t still breathing, one would think that he was already dead!

Before long, Wang Tong was left completely blind, and his blood was splattered all over his classmates. However, his mind had already collapsed, and it was unknown what was going on in his head. All the people around him couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable when they saw a man so devastated. 

But he wasn’t human now. Anyone that looked like that definitely had to be a demon!

{Congratulations to the players for winning the second round!} There was a light chuckle in the broadcast’s voice, like it had seen an amusing play. {This round will be the final one. You all must cut off player Wang Tong’s right leg!}

On the table where the bottle of sulfuric acid previously was, a saw had appeared.

Everyone slowly turned towards it, their expressions a bit unhinged. Yes, it was only a demon!

“Quickly bring that saw over here, hurry up!” Buzz Cut yelled to the people around him. He pressed down Wang Tong, who was already taking his last breath.

It was the final round! If they sawed off Wang Tong’s right leg, they would be able to survive! 

Everyone’s expressions contained hints of savagery and hideousness. In their madness, they had turned bloodthirsty.

Wang Tong lay on the ground. His entire right hand seemed to be corroded by something, and white bone jutted out from underneath the mutilated flesh. Even his skin was starting to peel off, all while plasma leaked from the back of his head. Both of his eyes had been dug out by others, and he was left with empty sockets, just like a skeleton. Fresh blood painted his face red as it oozed from the place where his eyes used to be. Wang Tong was motionless, looking no different from a corpse.

“Creak, creak.”

“Creak, creak.”

The students’ clothes, hands, and faces were stained with blood. Some stood, some sat, and some grabbed onto Wang Tong’s four limbs. 

They were expressionless, yet attentive. 

Faster! Much faster!

As long as his leg is sawed off, we can live!

Much faster! Much faster!

“Bam.” The saw fell to the ground.

Sawed off!

Everyone’s eyes bulged, filled with ecstasy. 

We’re going to live! So great!

{Checking health values. The health value of player Wang Tong, the KING of this round, is zero. The game fails.} The broadcast sounded precisely at this moment, with a taunting voice of undisturbed waves.

“What? Fails?”

“How can it be like this? Didn’t the broadcast say that we could survive if we completed the task?”

“I’m still young, I don’t want to die. Wuwu……”

All the people were dumbfounded. They initially thought that they had finally escaped the game and could be rewarded with the chance to live. Who could have predicted that there was this trick?

“But didn’t you say that! You simply didn’t say that Wang Tong couldn’t die!” A girl broke down, shouting loudly at the broadcast system. Her eyes brimmed with hatred. 

{I didn’t say that? My original words were: As long as you succeed, you can bring them and leave.} Surprisingly, the broadcast began to answer her question. {Since all characteristics of life have vanished from him, he can’t take you all away, am I correct?}

{As the game has already failed, you all have no way of leaving. Then, congratulations to Gao Xuhan for becoming the only player to escape.} The broadcast’s voice was slightly bewitching, but when it read Gao Xuhan’s name, it paused. At the same time, everyone burned with rage, their anger like a volcano that was about to erupt.

Why her? Why is it her?

Right! It’s exactly her!

She was the one who tampered with the rules of the game!

Why can she live? And why did they have to die? Disagree! I disagree!!

{Poor bugs, say goodbye to the world! After two hours, hell will reappear! You all! All of you go die!} The voice raised in decibels, and dragged on for a long time. When it finished the last word, it seemed like the broadcast system had been cut off halfway, and it abruptly went quiet. 

The vines, which had once flooded the whole room, retreated as quickly as they came.

In an instant, their surroundings were restored to their original appearance. 

But all the people present knew that this was merely the brief calm before the storm. 

Gao Xuhan’s legs softened. In the second that she opened the box, something rushed out, swiftly escaping. The box was clearly only the size of her hand, but what it contained was like a bottomless hole. Its features couldn’t be fully seen, though it was a deep black color and very thick and sticky. It crawled out little by little at an extremely slow speed, but wherever it went, it swallowed everything. Afterwards, those places looked like they had been corroded. Without end, it grew progressively larger. 

Gao Xuhan dashed out, running aimlessly until she was so exhausted she had to stop. Under a night lit by a scarlet moon, she gasped for breath, wondering where she could go. 

She wanted to hide, to live.

“Gao Xuhan!” A girl spotted her from afar. Her eyes were bloodshot, and in the moment that she shouted Gao Xuhan’s name, a group of people appeared behind her. Every one of them glared at Gao Xuhan as if she had murdered their father. 

Gao Xuhan was stunned. Her intuition told her that they didn’t have good intentions, so she started to back away. But when those people noticed that she wanted to flee, their expressions became even more ferocious. Similar to a swarm of bees, they all rushed to grab her. 

B*tch! You b*tch!

Why don’t you go and die!

Like a pitiful dog, Gao Xuhan was pushed to the ground. Before she could recover, she was pummeled by fists, and shoes landed on her lower abdomen, violently stomping.

Go to hell! Go to hell!

Xu Sheng stroked Senior’s hair, reluctant to let go.

He knew that this game was about to end.

The seven deadly sins will make everyone fall deep into hell.

Bai Qiaoqiao’s pride, Liu Chunming’s sloth, Yang Jie’s envy, Zhou Ping’s gluttony, Wang Tong’s greed, Gao Xuhan’s wrath.

As well as.

Xu Sheng peeked at the Senior in his embrace and lifted the corners of his mouth. 

As well as his own. Lust.

Bai Qiaoqiao held no one in her eyes, Liu Chunming’s laziness permitted his students’ reckless behavior, Yang Jie’s jealousy caused her to hurt others, Zhou Ping committed the crime of deception and was punished through binge eating, and Wang Tong and Gao Xuhan both died because of human nature. 

Xiao Chen buried his head in Xu Sheng’s chest, just like an innocent Barbie doll that was fooled by everyone. He was beautiful and delicate, so lovely that it was unfair.

“Senior,” Xu Sheng smiled.

Xiao Chen replied with a muffled voice, “Hm?”

“Wait for me!” Xu Sheng’s hands kept massaging Xiao Chen’s waist. “I will definitely return to your side!”

Then, in this life, you can’t leave me. 

He had always dreamed of having Senior for himself.

Xiao Chen blanked out. He felt inexplicably familiar with these words, and it even made him a bit tearful. His eyes were red as he said, “Okay.”

Xu Sheng’s smile deepened.

“Drowning Love”: “May my god retain the ability to leap over mountain forests, have the spiritual power to swim in ocean waves, and may my god forever stay here with eyes holding my being.”

And my god is you.

Xiao Chen abruptly woke up, staring at the ceiling in a daze. His head rested on a pillow and his body was covered with a thin blanket. The electric fan near his feet whirred.

It was so peaceful that he somewhat panicked.

He came back? Or was this place still within the dream?

Before he could get up and investigate, the phone on his nightstand dinged.

He had received a group text message.

‘Following deliberation by the school, considering that our students are under too much pressure, it has been decided that all grades will go on vacation for the next three days to adjust their mentality and relax themselves.’

Xiao Chen slightly parted his lips, and abruptly thought of something. He clicked on the school’s Tieba, his fingers trembling. 

Immediately, he saw the title of the pinned post at the top. 

《After the bullied Xu Sheng died, Bai Qiaoqiao committed suicide, and all the students in the first year’s Class 4 went insane..….》

First comment: I believe everyone already knows the two major events that happened yesterday. The first is that Bai Qiaoqiao jumped off a building in public, and the second is that the head teacher of the first year’s Class 4 impaled himself in the stomach. Now all the students in the class seem like they are possessed, and they will fight as soon as they see each other. They will even take out knives…especially the first year’s tyrant Wang Tong. Yesterday, he stabbed that boy with a buzz cut, who is normally the most obedient, until the other had to be sent to the hospital. Towards this, what do you guys think?

Second comment: What else can I think, it must be that Xu Sheng turned into a ghost and returned for revenge.

Third comment: Is the previous comment sick? What ghost, we are in a harmonious socialist society right now, alright? Who doesn’t know that Bai Qiaoqiao was the mastermind behind Xu Sheng’s demise? I also heard from an insider in the school that when they watched the playback of the security camera, Liu Chunming confessed that he never cared about Xu Sheng. He even opened one eye and closed one eye and let Bai Qiaoqiao humiliate him despite there being evidence for their bullying. Therefore, I think that Bai Qiaoqiao and Liu Chunming both committed suicide out of guilt and fear! The students in Class 4 collectively viewed Liu Chunming’s suicide, so it would be strange if they didn’t go crazy!

Fourth comment: I find this very weird. There are too many doubtful points. Even if they all were scared and became abnormal, they wouldn’t look and stab at each other like enemies! With how hard Wang Tong stabbed, I estimate that he has to go to jail! 

……

Xiao Chen scanned through rapidly, three lines at once, and was able to catch the first few comments. But when he turned the page, this post actually vanished into thin air. He understood that this had been handled by the higher-ups. 

He shut his eyes and took a deep breath before getting up. He walked towards the door of the room, but when his sight landed on the mirror in the corner, he was shocked.

He currently had on the pajamas he usually wore at home, which included a very fat and loose white T-shirt. Not only was his collarbone exposed a lot, but his shoulder blades as well.

But through the mirror, he observed that his entire neck and back were covered with kiss marks. And above his shoulder blade, there was a rose pattern. This rose had a snake wrapped around its stem, which refused to let go no matter what. But it was incomparably harmonious. If Xiao Chen didn’t recognize it incorrectly, that snake was a cobra.

This snake overbearingly climbed on the rose’s body, revealing its tongue with divinity in its eyes. It looked so realistic that it was almost as if a real snake was lying on his back. At first glance, it was a bit creepy, but when Xiao Chen absentmindedly stared at it, his eyes uncontrollably filled with tears. 

Xu Han slightly opened her eyes and saw the clean white walls of the hospital ward, as well as the people sitting beside her bed.

Her eyes reddened. “Dad! Mom!”

The doctors and the family members who heard her were shocked, but they brightened up. “She woke up, she woke up! Xu Han woke up!”

The woman had gray hair and was a little fat. She appeared haggard, and she had obvious dark circles under her eyes. “It’s good that you woke up! In the future, don’t charge your phone by the bed! The next time there is an accident, what do you want me and your dad to do?”

Xu Han cried. She had never thought about how to thank God as much as right now. She was still alive and could see her parents! When she remembered how she was killed by other people, she was both frightened and extremely grateful. 

Fortunately! Fortunately!

The moment she died, she suddenly realized many things! Parents, myself, friends, all the pieces of her past, it was said that people would regret their life when faced with death, and this was really not false! After she experienced death, she woke up. 

Regret!

But now!

Xu Han looked at the parents in front of her before sobbing.

Everything was not too late!


 “Senior Xiao Chen, I like you!” A girl with braids and tiny dimples on her cheeks blocked Xiao Chen’s way. She seemed clever and had very good skin, giving off the feeling of a little girl next door. This feeling was refreshing and clean, and the girl was shorter than Xiao Chen by a head. 

Xiao Chen blanked out.

When he heard the word “Senior”, he would always think of that person, the one who had told him to wait for him, but had been dead for three years. 

Xiao Chen pursed his lips and shook his head as he said, “I’m sorry.”

The girl was stunned. With one glance, anyone could tell that she was a little miss who had been pampered since birth. She had never been rejected, so when Xiao Chen did so, her eyes reddened. But she quickly recovered and stuffed the drink she had bought into Xiao Chen’s arms, before running away without looking back. 

Xiao Chen was a bit absentminded as he held the drink. He glanced in the girl’s direction and silently clasped the drink. 

“F*ck, it’s Senior Xiao Chen! The real person looks too much better than the photos!”

“Senior Xiao Chen is really so kind! He’s studying design, and his clothes are matched exactly like a celebrity’s!”

“I’m crying, I didn’t imagine that I could meet the living Senior Xiao Chen. I heard that for the whole last semester, he was away at an internship. I didn’t expect that he would come back as soon as the new semester began!”

“Hmph! Such a good-looking senior, see for yourself how many girls peeked at him just now!”

Discussions rose and fell one after another, and the large majority of those participating were female. Xiao Chen sighed in his heart. He had long grown used to constantly being watched like a monkey. 

Today was the first day of university for the first years, so there were many immature and unfamiliar faces. 

Xiao Chen had a monotonous lifestyle and a flat attitude towards everyone. People who didn’t know him well would believe that he was gentle, but those that did would say he was merely aloof. 

Just when Xiao Chen was ready to go, someone called him.

“Xiao Chen!” A voice shouted his name extremely loudly. 

Xiao Chen hesitantly turned around.

“You were fooled, okay? You didn’t think that you would be caught by me! Let’s go! Today, all the freshman girls are starting school, so help my club recruit new members!” It was one of Xiao Chen’s dormitory roommates, a rough Northeasterner named Li Guo.

Xiao Chen seldom refused others in such matters, and Li Guo had deliberately asked him because he noticed this.

Xiao Chen helplessly nodded.

There was a throng of both boys and girls gathered on the basketball court. During these hot days, there were few such scenes in the school. 

“This is too weird, why are there so many people at the basketball court today?” Li Guo was a heavy gossiper and very outgoing. He had always liked to join in on lively things. “Isn’t it simply playing basketball? Weird!”

After he said this, he wanted to pull Xiao Chen and walk forward. Xiao Chen wasn’t comfortable in crowded situations, and especially when it was hot. He said softly, “Go, I’ll just wait for you here.”

Li Guo knew his temperament and didn’t force the other. By himself, he went ahead.

Xiao Chen could hear the continuous screams and cheers on the basketball court from a long distance away. The basketball hit the ground with a thump, and was followed by the girls’ excited shrieks.

Goal! Goal! Another goal!

Xiao Chen’s gaze was light as he glanced at the situation on the court.

“Ah!” Something happened, and suddenly everyone exclaimed together at the same time. Before Xiao Chen could react, he saw that they were all staring at him in horror. A basketball was about to collide with his body.

Xiao Chen was startled and used his hands to protect his head. 

The basketball didn’t reach him as expected.

A black shadow stood in front of him, having moved so fast that it was incredible. Even Xiao Chen was taken aback.

“……”

“Are you alright?”

Xiao Chen slightly opened his mouth.

The boy had a pair of gray eyes, mature facial features, and thin lips that were perfect. 

“You…” Before Xiao Chen could finish speaking, the boy turned back indifferently and threw the ball he had just caught towards the basketball court.

“Clunk.” Three points.

The audience was silent.

The boy returned to face Xiao Chen with a smile again. “Senior, let’s go together.”

Xiao Chen was shocked. As if he had lost his soul, he let the boy take his hand and head to a place with less people. Even as Li Guo yelled loudly behind him, he didn’t listen. He could only feel the warmth of the palm touching his own.

“Xu Sheng?” Xiao Chen tentatively said, uncertainty in his expression. 

To be honest, this person, except for the gray eyes, was nothing like Xu Sheng. His overall appearance, face, and disposition were different. But somehow, Xiao Chen already thought in his heart that he was Xu Sheng.

The other party chuckled, “It’s me.” He stopped, gazing deeply at Xiao Chen. “Senior, I’m back.”

A University’s formal post was pushed up again. 

The post’s title was: I’m crying, the school grass and the computer department grass are together.

Topic creator: Foreword: Don’t look me up, I’d like to keep a pair of underpants for the New Year.

Topic creator: Don’t ask me who I am, I can only say that I am an admirer of the school grass!! My mood at this moment is extremely complicated! Why, you ask? I f*cking saw the school grass being pressed against a tree and kissed by the department grass! (Ten thousand critical hits to single dogs.)

In the beginning, I couldn’t figure out who they were because it was nighttime. It was also in the little forest near the cafeteria, where few would go at night. Back then, I could see two people from very far away. And obviously two men!

At that time, I went WTF. My curiosity was killing me. I thought that the pair had hid because they were too shy, which meant that they would not allow me to meet them. The result? The result was that in the next second, I observed the department grass hugging the cute school grass as they walked out of the little forest! Ignoring me the entire time! I cried!

I can guarantee that the department grass definitely recognized who I am! He just wanted to show me!

Why? Because I have confessed to the school grass before (cold face), because I am in the same department as the school grass, and I have a class with him. I confessed to him in the classroom, but the department grass was sitting by him when I did so! I was wondering then…but I didn’t imagine…

But this is all not the point! The following is!

How do I say this, this is the first time I’ve seen the school grass smiling so joyfully! The school grass has always been gentle and elegant. He is very good to everyone, so good that it almost makes one feel that it is false. But he is exploding in Su, and is immensely skilled at poking girls’ hearts! He has a light smile and slightly raised lucky phoenix eyes, the kind that will melt hearts! But the smile I saw this time was the real smile of someone happy to their bones. When the two of them looked at each other a little, they freely showed their scorching hot feelings!!

I’m dead!! Really!! The Su blasted away this old lady’s young heart!!!

So, the topic creator was full of questions and boldly asked the school grass on the second day. 

After the school grass heard my question, he actually smiled again, my god!

He just said one word. “En.”

AHHHHHHH!

Anyways! In short! I love this couple!

Topic creator: Yes, it’s me again. I’m here to share the things that have to be said between the school grass and the department grass!

Ever since I discovered the relationship between the two, I have been really fed full by the dog food.

Now that it’s winter, I have honestly been accustomed to lovers giving each other scarves or gloves or whatever as gifts.

But! Do you guys know what I saw?

As the male god of our department! Straight A student! He wasn’t listening in class, and was secretly doing something else! What was he doing?

Oh, I’m certain that you have already guessed what it was! Knitting a scarf!

Afterwards, I watched with wide eyes as the school grass knit that scarf for three whole days! The following day, it appeared around the department grass’s neck! What else can I say???

Is this not true love?

Topic creator: It’s me, it’s me! It’s me again! I’ve come again!

The focus of today’s breaking news is the department grass!!! This man is d*mn sweet!!

Truthfully, it might be because I encounter the school grass more, so I only noticed his actions. In my heart, I had always thought that the school grass was the one who contributed the most to the relationship. 

But today, my beliefs were completely overturned!!

Many people must have heard of the event today. I’ll tell you guys, I happened to be at the scene!! I’ll recount the plot for you guys!

At that time, our school grass and department grass were separated by about two meters. The school grass was on the phone. So when the car came, he was clearly dumbfounded. He stopped functioning and froze in place.

The department grass was like a cheetah, and that speed, oh my god! Too amazing! He rushed up and pulled the school grass into his embrace, tightly hugging him!

You guys all know about this, right? But there’s actually more!!

The department grass was crying as he held the school grass! I actually saw the school grass repeatedly coaxing and comforting him!

In that moment, really, I thought that their world couldn’t fit anyone else, and they were the perfect match!

I can only say that they will be together for a long time! Unmistakably! I have very accurate vision! Their feelings are too real! Let the others beside them be envious of this powerful love!

“Senior.”

“Hm?”

“I love you.”

“Well, I love you too!”

Arc 1 The God of Death is Coming

 “AHHH!” The woman had a bulging belly, and her legs were spread apart. Her hair was soaked with sticky sweat as she screamed and closed her eyes, arching her back in effort. The expression on her face turned slightly hideous because of the agony. 

“Quickly, quickly! The pregnant woman is bleeding severely!!!” The group of doctors beside her wore green surgical gowns and panicked as chaos ensued. 

Tears gushed from the corners of the woman’s eyes, and the pain in her abdomen was as intense as breaking a bone. 

But no one noticed that there was actually a man in a black robe standing motionlessly next to the operating table. Only his chin was revealed, as the rest of his face was completely shrouded. Both of his eyes were hidden under a hat, giving him an air of unfathomable mystery. Around his neck, he had a necklace with a pendant in the shape of something similar to a sickle. Like a block of wood, he remained still.

No one went up to scold him, make him leave, or talk to him.

It was just like all the people couldn’t see him …

He slowly raised his hand, black mist condensing around it.

“Doctor! I can’t do it! Save the little one! I beg you guys!! This is my dead husband’s only child!” The woman looked agitated as she panted heavily. Her voice was weak, and she seemed to have used all of her strength to say those words.

“The exit is barely contracting now. If you want to save the baby, you will most likely die from excessive blood loss. Do you know this?” The doctor appeared very stressed, but he was quick in thinking and did not stop his hand movements. 

“I beg you guys!! Ah!” The woman’s lips were pale, and her voice was gradually fading. It was only when the pain was unbearable that she would shriek.

“Pregnant woman, you should stabilize your emotions first. The hospital has never had the mindset of choosing between keeping the big one or little one,” the doctor swiftly said. The cold sweat on his forehead continued to flow.

The mysterious man indifferently observed the scene of disorder in front of him.

But it was evident that the woman didn’t take the doctor’s advice to heart, and her expression collapsed.

The doctors worked hard to boost their morale. Time passed by in seconds and minutes, but the situation did not improve.

Gave birth! Gave birth!

The baby is out!

But the head doctor wasn’t happy for long before his hands started to quiver and his face fell. 

The child had no signs of life as soon as he was born!

The doctor next to him exclaimed, “Not good, the pregnant woman fainted!” 

Everyone started to work in a hurry again.

The man turned around, ready to leave. But for some reason, his eyes returned to the baby who had already died. He pondered, remaining in the same posture for a long time. Eventually, he looked away and disappeared. 

Suddenly, a medical staff member responsible for assisting the doctors amazingly discovered that the baby had come back to life, and had even started to cry and kick. 

“Ring, ring! Ring, ring!” The alarm clock placed beside the bed began to sound. 

Xiao Chen sat up in bed, still muddleheaded. He reached out to turn off the alarm, and then casually ruffled his own hair. 

Without knowing what he had thought of, he unconsciously unbuttoned the collar of his shirt. He dipped his head and examined his chest and collarbone.

There was a patch of blue and purple kiss marks.

Xiao Chen groaned internally, but only let out a grunt on the outside.

It must have been him again.

Xiao Chen glanced at the night stand. There was a note. He couldn’t help but pout when he read the text on it.

There was only one sentence: Don’t go out today.

Xiao Chen grit his teeth.

Originally, there was a club activity today, and he was going to go climb Tang Shan mountain with the others. 

What, he was actually not allowed to go out?

He snorted coldly, a bit sulky. Planning to go outside, he went to change his clothes, rinse his mouth, and tidy up his appearance. 

But the moment after he closed the door, a man emerged out of nowhere. This man was dressed entirely in black. He had black jeans and a black shirt, as well as a necklace with a sickle hanging from it.

He shook his head, sighing with a bit of helplessness and indulgence.

He just knew that this child wouldn’t listen.

Today, the sun was very fierce, enough to make people dizzy. 

Xiao Chen frowned. He had felt that something was wrong the instant he got on the charter bus.

He was extremely sensitive to the outside world, especially when he encountered an event of death. He had a sixth sense, and it could even be said that he could foresee death. 

When he was young, he would often experience being at the edge of death. But he was always able to escape its threat because of his observation skills and inexplicable sixth sense. At the age of 12, that man had appeared, and he never went through these things again. 

The five-digit license plate number of this bus was 74666.

74 was a homonym for go die, and 666 in the New Testament meant the number of the beast, the Devil’s number.

This promptly gave Xiao Chen a bad hunch. As he recalled the note the man had left this morning, he only needed one second to hesitate before preparing to get off. 

He believed in his premonition. 

But before he could stand up, Liang Jing, who was previously sleeping next to him, abruptly opened his eyes. His face was full of fear and horror. Xiao Chen hadn’t even reacted before he heard the other yell, “Stop the bus, stop the bus! I’m not going anymore!!” 

At this time, all the people on the bus were drowsy, and no one was talking. Liang Jing’s loud voice awakened a few of them in fright. Since he was sitting in the last row, everyone soon turned their heads to glare at him in irritation. 

He was slightly trembling, but he didn’t care this much. He grabbed Xiao Chen’s hand and said, “Xiao Chen, trust me, we have to hurry and exit the bus!”

The guide also wrinkled his brow. His seat was in the first row, but he had still heard the noise. He headed towards the back, seemingly wanting to argue on something.

Liang Jing shook another close buddy, appearing exceedingly anxious and about to cry. “Let’s quickly go! A landslide will happen soon!” 

There was an uproar, and everyone looked at him like he was mentally ill. Not to mention others, even Liang Jing’s girlfriend Wang Xing suspected that he had gone insane. 

Xiao Chen immediately recovered. He realized something and also shouted, “We are going to get off! Let us go down!”

“They must be crazy! Where did these lunatics come from?”

“WTF! What sort of sh*tty words are those! D*mn it! My good mood this whole day has been ruined!!”

“Sickos! Driver! Quickly let them go!! They’re disturbing us!!”

After the six of them were kicked out by the guide and the tourists, they looked around the desolate mountain road. Wang Xing was angered to the point of laughing. “Liang Jing, what’s wrong with you? What’s the matter?”

Yang Meili, who wore a floral dress, was Wang Xing’s good friend. She peeked at Liang Jing with some resentment too.

Even if Liang Jing had a hundred mouths, he would be unable to retort. He nervously said, “Believe me, you guys, I saw it. In a short amount of time, the boulders at the top of the mountain will hit the bus, breaking it in half. Some of the people will be directly smashed to death, while others will fall off the cliff.”

Even the most honest Yuan Zhong couldn’t stand it any longer. He frowned, and was about to scold Liang Jing with a few sentences. But before he could speak, the entire group froze in place.

A huge stone hurtled down the mountain. Because the road was an uphill spiral and there were no trees, they could still see the rear of the bus that hadn’t traveled far. 

They were thoroughly stunned. Just like what Liang Jing had said, the boulders rapidly fell, landing perfectly on the passing bus as if they had been prepared beforehand. They directly collided with the roof, causing the bus to instantly flip over and split into two. One of the halves precariously dangled over the cliff.

Without giving the survivors’ the opportunity to ease their worries, the bus that had already stopped at the edge actually tilted over uncontrollably. Even the person who had clung to the cliff and was about to climb up plunged downwards!

“Bam!” There was a loud noise.

All the people who saw this scene were frightened. After a period where they were all frozen in fear, they couldn’t hold back their questioning gazes towards Liang Jing. 

Li Haibo was even more overwhelmed. He peered at Liang Jing and asked, “How, how could you know?”

In unison, everyone stared intensely at Liang Jing as if this was their first meeting with him. Their eyes carried terror and shock.

Only Xiao Chen could be counted as calm. He gazed expressionlessly in the direction of the bus.

He saw it!

The man in a black robe stood unmoving beside the bus and watched everything that happened around him. When all was settled, he steadily turned back and faced Xiao Chen. But Xiao Chen couldn’t discern the other person’s covered face. 

However, in his heart, he already had an answer.

For a long time, the man had appeared out of thin air. Once more, he vanished the same way.


 “You said you saw it? How did you see it?” Yuan Zhong couldn’t hold back his curiosity, and he felt that these words were shocking and unbelievable.

Liang Jing squatted on the ground, his entire being seeming like it was about to collapse. He knew that he hadn’t dreamed at all, but had instead been reborn!

He had just recovered from the pain of death and returned to the time before he died. 

How could he not break down?

He crazily shook his head, and his mind was a mess. “I don’t know, I don’t know, don’t ask anymore!”

Noticing that everyone appeared to be dissatisfied with this answer and was planning to bring up something else, Xiao Chen immediately came forward. He said, “Let’s call the police first so they can handle this matter. In regards to Liang Jing’s situation, don’t let it spread outside!”

Liang Jing heard him and glanced at him gratefully. Everything was so unreal to him, like the feeling of escaping after a robbery. 

All the people exhaled deeply, looking at each other with some fear. The only two girls in the group had pale faces. But Xiao Chen frowned, pondering over something. 

The sun hung high in the sky. It shone and directly bathed everyone in light.

When they weren’t paying attention, Xiao Chen gazed at the people around him with a mysterious look in his eyes.

No accidents, no coincidences, nowhere to run!

No one can deceive the god of death!

Xiao Chen observed the group. They were all in a daze, and a heavy atmosphere pervaded their surroundings. He closed his eyes.

The god of death will use his scythe to kill those that cheated death. Everyone has nowhere to escape!

Deaths will continue to happen. 

Next, who will die? Heh.

“Now do you know that you were wrong?” The man stroked Xiao Chen’s head, pampering and cuddling the other in his arms.

Xiao Chen coldly huffed, repeatedly poking the man’s chest with his index finger. “Who made you not tell me! You didn’t clearly say it!”

The man laughed at this little ancestor and wrapped his hand around Xiao Chen’s index finger. Then, he moved downwards until his palm held and protected the other’s. 

The temperature of his hand wasn’t normal. To be precise, there was no temperature. And this was the same for the rest of his body. 

Xiao Chen leaned against the man’s chest, swinging his legs in a lovely way.

In front of the man, he was cute and playful. But for everyone else, he would show his mature side. This was his own protective shell, and he would use it whenever he interacted with others. 

The man’s appearance in his life had made up for his lack of fatherly love. He had allowed Xiao Chen to experience feelings beyond all those in the world. 

Xiao Chen depended on him, worshipped him, and deeply loved him.

“Will they all die?” He stared at the man with extremely innocent eyes. 

The man ruffled his hair, praising his acting. “Yes.”

Xiao Chen nodded. “Oh.”

He didn’t really care about anyone other than the man. His personality was flawed. He had lost his parents when he was young, and was later tossed among his relatives. In the end, he was sent to the orphanage. Plus, he had faced the bizarre threat of death many times. 

Xiao Chen was more mature than others at his age, so there wasn’t a single friend by his side. He even suffered from emotional detachment. It was only when the man was present that he would behave like a normal child his age. 

“Are you not leaving today?” Xiao Chen seemed to think of something, and he raised his head excitedly. He pulled his arms out of the man’s embrace and turned around. When they were face to face, he moved his hands to grip the man’s shoulders. “You will sleep with me today, right?”

The man felt it was a bit funny. 

This child was always too straightforward. When he said sleep, he literally meant just sleeping together. There wasn’t the slightest trace of another more alluring meaning.

“Yes.”

Xiao Chen was just like a child who had been rewarded with candy by an adult. He shook the man’s shoulders non-stop. “I’m so happy!”

Liang Jing exhaled as he sat alone on the doorsteps in front of his house. 

He looked haggard, and even when he saw the breakup message sent by his girlfriend Wang Xing, he merely sighed. He seemed to have lost his soul as he gazed ahead at the crowd of people walking back and forth.

I’m still alive…

I can actually continue to live?

Liang Jing began to tremble, and he felt as though he was on the verge of crying. But he was unaware that changes were happening to the mechanical watch on his wrist. The minute hand, hour hand, and second hand were slowly pointing to the number four. Now, they almost overlapped. 

“Tick, tick! Tick, tick!” The sound was so faint that it couldn’t be heard.

“Hiss!” Liang Jing breathed in the cool air. He was too amazed by the fact that he was alive. As he poked the stones on the ground, he had no idea that his index finger had been pricked by a sharp edge. A drop of blood squeezed out. 

At this time, Liang Jing seemed to have recovered. Without looking back, he stood up and opened the front door.

The moment the door closed, a small car abruptly lost control and crashed into the doorsteps. Its speed was so fast that it left the people on the streets dumbfounded. 

But simply no one was injured.

As soon as Xiao Chen went inside, he sensed that the mood in the club was weird.

Their club was named the Extreme Challenge club. They enjoyed stimulating extreme sports, bungee jumping, ice skating, drop towers, skateboarding… 

It was precisely because the members were too brave that even though the club had existed for a long time, they didn’t need to pay for operating costs. In addition, Li Haibo was a wronged big head, and he would always give money to the club. Despite this, few were willing to join. There were only six members, including Xiao Chen.

Once he saw that everyone had arrived, Li Haibo said to Wang Xing with a serious expression, “What’s the matter with you and Yang Meili? Why did you two call all of us here? Now, the atmosphere is so heavy, and you won’t say anything until all the people are here.”

Wang Xing was depressed and weak, and there were dark circles under her eyes. She appeared as if she hadn’t slept for days, and some pimples had emerged on her originally unblemished skin. 

Yang Meili fared worse. She was shaking all over, and her hands tightly clutched Wang Xing’s arm. It was as if she was afraid that someone would separate them. 

“Don’t you guys think that there have been abnormal occurrences ever since that day?” Ultimately, Wang Xing broke the awkward silence.

“What?” Liang Jing, who had been sitting quietly to the side, swiftly reacted.

“Isn’t it strange? Since that day, I have encountered all sorts of accidents, big and small. Initially, I accidentally cut my hand with a knife, but later, cars frequently almost crashed into me! Even when I got on the elevator, I was locked inside!”

Wang Xing’s eyes were wide, and she was a little scared. “At first, I believed it was only me. But yesterday, a flower pot almost smashed onto Yang Meili and I as we were walking. When I asked her, she said that she had also gone through all kinds of unusual events!”

Liang Jing’s lips were pale, and he thought of something. He said, “Recently, it’s been like this for me too.”

Yuan Zhong and Li Haibo refuted them. Li Haibo laughed with a bit of ridicule. “I assumed it was something important, but women actually have so many farts! If they are hit by flower pots, they must blame it on the supernatural!”

Wang Xing was somewhat embarrassed and annoyed. “How can it not be possible? Didn’t Liang Jing have a dream?”

All the people in the room suddenly froze.

This was a topic that they had agreed to never bring up. They chose not to talk about it, and tried to bypass it as much as possible. But they didn’t expect that Wang Xing would mention it so directly.

Liang Jing’s expression changed and he didn’t speak.

Wang Xing realized that this was not right, and her voice immediately softened. “I think that we need to be careful. Yang Meili and I just wanted to remind everyone so that you guys can consider this more.”

Yuan Zhong let out a “huh” sound, and didn’t give a response. Most likely, he didn’t believe it. 

Li Haibo angrily said, “Okay, okay, whatever. Later, I’m going to go dive in the sea. Who wants to go?”

Wang Xing rolled her eyes, Yang Meili definitely wasn’t in the mood, and Liang Jing was still immersed in his own thoughts.

Li Haibo glanced at Yuan Zhong, who shrugged. “You know I have to work.”

Li Haibo raised his eyebrows and moved his sight to Xiao Chen. The other massaged the back of his shoulder with his left hand. “No time, I really want to sleep today.”

Li Haibo pouted. “Fine, I’ll go by myself!”

Xiao Chen stared back wordlessly. His hand stopped at his shoulder blade. There was a vague tattoo of a rose on his skin, and he gently pinched that area to ease his pain. 

You may be able to evade the death penalty the first time.

But from the moment you luckily survived!

Death will always accompany you!

Because no one can escape death.



 Li Haibo changed into his diving suit, stretched his neck, and did some warm-up exercises. He was planning to go diving in the sea. In this area, there were very little people diving. However, the view under the sea could be described as good. There were green, red, and black seaweed. He had dived here a few times before, and had spotted jellyfish, sea lions, sea stars, and whales. But he had never encountered danger. 

“Swish, swish.” A sea snake with an olive underside slowly climbed up from the waters. Its torso was cylindrical, and its body was long and slender. At the end of the snake, there was a somewhat flat tail. Overall, it was a meter in length. 

After the sea snake reached land, it slithered straight in Li Haibo’s direction. Its movements couldn’t be considered fast, and Li Haibo was quite far away from the sea. But practically the instant the snake appeared in his sight, Li Haibo turned towards it. After all, it was rather large.

Li Haibo’s heart leapt. He was wearing a dive skin, so he would definitely die if he was bitten by the snake! It had to be known that sea snakes had a very strong venom!

Li Haibo rapidly scrambled backwards in fear, wanting to hide. 

The sea snake unhurriedly advanced. It raised its head, its eyes carelessly passing over Li Haibo. But it only paused for a moment, and didn’t seem to have the intention of attacking him.

“Swish, swish.” It slowly headed back to the sea, but this time, it was actually much quicker than when it came.

Li Haibo’s legs were a bit soft, and he couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.

Fortunately, nothing happened.

He sorted out his clothes all over again, put on his diving mask, wore his swim fins, and carried his diving tank. Then, he was ready to go diving.

But he didn’t notice that there was a menace concealed beneath the calm sea.

One sea snake after another gradually approached this area of the sea…

And Li Haibo’s head was enveloped in a layer of black gas that he could not perceive.

“What are you talking about?” Liang Jing’s eyes were wide, and he blanked out. These days, the frequent accidents had worn him down until his scalp tingled. “Li Haibo died?”

Wang Xing was slightly frightened. “I heard he was poisoned to death by sea snakes! Afterwards, the scent of blood attracted a great white shark! The police over there have already confirmed the body is Li Haibo’s through DNA.”

The surroundings were abruptly silent.

Wang Xing had found this information in the classmates’ group chat. There was even a photo taken at the scene of the accident. In it, the only part of Li Haibo that remained was a pile of white bones. The fins on his feet hadn’t been taken off, and there was already nothing left of his internal organs. Perhaps because of being gnawed on by a great white shark and additionally being washed away by the sea water, Li Haibo’s entire head was reduced to a bare skull. The only piece with hair also retained some flesh. His facial features completely couldn’t be discerned! What was even more terrifying was that in the photo, several sea snakes were still coiled around Li Haibo’s corpse. There were even all kinds of insects nibbling at his bones. Wang Xing only took one look at that photo before vomiting out everything that she had eaten today in disgust! 

Who would have thought that this pile of white bones would actually turn out to be Li Haibo, the one who had been discussing with them yesterday about going diving? A living person!

“This is all too coincidental!” Wang Xing swallowed her saliva. “I don’t believe that this world has such coincidental things. Have we been caught up in something unclean?”

When Yang Meili heard those words, she trembled. She looked like she hadn’t slept well for many days. 

Liang Jing’s expression was the worst. He had been reborn! Whether or not the world had unexplainable supernatural events, who could know more than him? Wasn’t his own existence an example?

Could it be that even after returning, he would still die? How could he be willing?

Xiao Chen, who had been wordlessly observing on the side for a long time, raised the corner of his mouth. The changes on his face weren’t easy to detect, but he swiftly recovered to being expressionless. His eyes slightly narrowed. As if he was speaking to himself, he brought up his own question. “Is it possible that there is a god of death in this world?”

“What?” Yuan Zhong didn’t hear clearly, so he stared at Xiao Chen. 

On the other hand, Liang Jing was shocked. 

Xiao Chen lifted his gaze. “I once heard that when humans commit an unforgivable sin, the Grim Reaper will create a coincidence to gather all of them and let them die in the same accident.”

Liang Jing started to tighten his fists. He was not the only one. The expressions of Wang Xing, Yang Meili, and Yuan Zhong were stiff. 

Xiao Chan weirdly blinked his eyes. “If a sinful person unexpectedly escapes, they will receive the curse of death.” He scanned everyone and turned his head. “No death, no rest.”

The atmosphere in the room was a little strange at the moment, and it was terrifyingly quiet. The looks they directed towards Xiao Chen were even more unclear and complicated.

“What are you guys doing, watching me like this?” Xiao Chen put on his usual smile, and the corners of his mouth curved. “It’s not like we’re any kind of sinners. Plus, I’ve already said that this was something I heard about.”

All the people were somewhat comforted, until Xiao Chen closely followed up. With a beaming smile that revealed eight teeth, he appeared a bit cute. “What if you guys are sinners? Anyways, I’m not!”

Liang Jing choked and suddenly remembered something.

Correct! That’s right!

Before the accident in his last life, Xiao Chen received an emergency call from home and then got off the bus in a hurry!

He didn’t die at all!

Liang Jing recalled up to here, and his complexion was sallow. But when he thought of Xiao Chen’s words, he uncontrollably shook.

He had almost forgotten such peaceful scenes from back then…

Without waiting for Liang Jing to recollect himself, Xiao Chen abruptly smiled again. “Doesn’t it seem like the Snake Pit’s punishment?”

“What?” Wang Xing didn’t understand.

“Li Haibo’s death.” Xiao Chen tilted his head. “Have you not heard of this criminal law? It was used by Daji to punish court ladies. Their clothes were stripped off, and then they were thrown into a hole filled with vipers, bees, and the like. The court ladies were left to be bitten ravenously by hundreds of insects.”

At this point, Yang Meili’s face turned pale at a speed visible to the naked eye. She was so revolted that she directly threw up. 

Probably because she hadn’t eaten much in the first place, she only spit out sour water. Along with what Xiao Chen had said, this sour smell made everyone present look disturbed. Their stomachs churned as if mountains and seas were being overturned inside. They were filled with nausea. 

But at this moment, Liang Jing obscurely met Wang Xing’s eyes, and seemingly exchanged something. Afterwards, he quickly retracted his gaze.

“Is there really a god of death?” Wang Xing heavily gasped, slightly shivering.

“I don’t know.” Liang Jing’s face was the color of dead ash.

“The two of us at that time …” Wang Xing wanted to continue to say something, but was immediately interrupted by Liang Jing.

“Didn’t we agree to never mention that again?”

Liang Jing’s voice suddenly raised, and his eyes were terror-stricken. He looked around and took a deep, quivering breath.

“Okay! Then tell me, did you really dream about that day’s events?” Wang Xing aggressively asked.

“…Yes!” Liang Jing’s eyes dodged. Fortunately, his back faced Wang Xing, so she couldn’t see.

“What is Li Haibo’s sin?” Xiao Chen wrapped both his arms around the man’s neck, a little curious.

“Perversion.” The man was concise.

“He hurt his own cousin, and that girl committed suicide.”

“What is my sin?” Xiao Chen withdrew his gaze and looked the man in the eye.

“……” There was a moment of silence.

Your sin is me.


 “I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, God’s only Son, our Lord. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting! Amen!” Yang Meili first drew a cross on her chest, using both of her hands to tightly grasp the cross necklace hanging around her neck. She endlessly repeated these words, immersed in her own emotions. 

An icy-cold wind slowly blew inside and touched the skin on her neck, causing her to involuntarily shiver. She opened her eyes, which had originally been closed, and scanned the room.

There was simple furniture, a limited amount of space, and the pattern of an inverted pentagram affixed to a wall. And at the center of the pattern was a goat. Everything looked the same as usual.

Yang Meili erased the panic in her heart as her gaze moved back to the headboard of her bed. A puppet with the appearance of a girl was placed there. It wore a pink barbie dress, and its two eyes were surprisingly large. They didn’t blink, but they seemed to shine with life. 

Yang Meili hugged the puppet in her arms. She thought of something, and a sob escaped from her.

“Mommy…”

“Why don’t you want me anymore…?”

Yang Meili was extremely shocked. She immediately snatched a white medicine bottle on the nightstand and fumbled to take off the lid. She ravenously swallowed two pills. There were dark circles under her eyes, and she had already begun to tremble.

“Mommy…” Even after Yang Meili ate the medicine, the distant voice didn’t fade. It even grew increasingly louder. 

Outside the window, lightning flashed and thunder roared. The wind whistled as it hurtled through the air, and the rain emitted pitter-patter noises when it hit the window. 

Yang Meili abruptly stood up from the bed and then fiercely ran out of the room. She grabbed a clear umbrella by the door. Despite the fact that she was still wearing slippers, she raced out, looking dazed and frightened. 

She had rented an old apartment. The building didn’t have an elevator, and she lived on the 13th floor. 

No one could tell what was going on in her mind. She rapidly ran down the stairs, the umbrella still in her hands. It almost seemed as if she was being chased by something unclean. 

“Bam.” Perhaps because of her slippers, her right foot suddenly twisted and her entire body toppled forward. And the umbrella she held in her hand was also flung away. 

First, it hit the steps of the stairs and rebounded. It turned in a circle, becoming vertical in the air. 

The tip of the umbrella reflected in Yang Meili’s pupil as she fell down uncontrollably. And the umbrella was pointing towards her throat…

“Yang Meili died?” Wang Xing froze.

“Yes;” Liang Jing was also somewhat absentminded. “Supposedly, she tripped when she was going down the stairs, and her throat was pierced by the tip of a clear umbrella.”

“;;” Wang Xing subconsciously touched her own neck, and her breathing was messy. 

She had known Yang Meili for more than ten years, so she was familiar with the other’s mental condition. When Yang Meili was in high school, she was a bit promis/cuous. She had gone through many boyfriends, and later she actually got pregnant. Her belly grew every day, yet she didn’t even know who the father was. It was only when she was already six months pregnant that she was unable to hide it. She was dragged by her family to a private pheasant hospital to get an abortion. Ever since then, she became mentally debilitated and fell ill with an incurable mental disorder. Yang Meili unexpectedly started to believe in Christianity in the name of atonement. She prayed daily.

The reason why Yang Meili joined this club was because she was invited by Wang Xing. Yang Meili always acted somewhat strangely, so she didn’t have any friends. 

“The police concluded in their preliminary investigation that she had auditory hallucinations. There were leftover pills on the floor of her room, so when she went down the stairs, she was in a trance. Then……” Liang Jing trailed off.

Yuan Zhong, who had listened at the side for a long time, couldn’t stand it anymore. “Liang Jing! At this time, you still won’t reveal the truth?”

“What?” Liang Jing raised his gaze weakly. He hadn’t gotten a good rest recently.

“What actually happened in the accident that day? Tell everyone the details of your dream. We can’t continue to sit back and await death!” It could be seen that Yuan Zhong’s mental state was also bad these days. He, who originally didn’t believe in such supernatural events, was also beginning to have suspicions. 

Meanwhile, Xiao Chen just sat quietly and didn’t speak. His expression looked serious, as if he was contemplating.

Liang Jing exhaled deeply. Suddenly, something in his mind clicked. His eyes widened immediately. “I understand!”

“What?” Wang Xing was extremely attentive. She stared at Liang Jing, her eyes blazing like a torch. 

“Do you remember the positions of our seats that day?” Liang Jing was a little excited, and his body was trembling. “We all sat in the last few rows! I sat with Xiao Chen, you sat with Yang Meili, and Yuan Zhong and Li Haibo sat together!”

“Yes! That’s right!” Yuan Zhong nodded.

“In my dream, when the accident occured, it was too sudden! Yang Meili and Li Haibo had seats by the aisle, so they were the initial ones to be thrown out! Li Haibo plunged to the bottom of the cliff first. Yang Meili had hung onto the rear of the bus, and only fell after Li Haibo! Afterwards, it was Wang Xing, Yuan Zhong, and me! Could this be the order of our deaths?”

Wang Xing shuddered, and thought of something. “What about Xiao Chen?”

Everyone’s sight turned to Xiao Chen. He calmly accepted their scrutiny and seemed to be very focused on Liang Jing’s words. 

Liang Jing sighed, and said with a hoarse voice, “He got off the bus early…”

Silence……

“I don’t want to die……” Wang Xing was dumbfounded. If this was really the order of their deaths, wouldn’t she be the next to die? How could she just welcome that?

“What should we do? What should we do? We have to find a way to save ourselves!” Wang Xing was so anxious that she was about to cry, and she was shaking all over.

Xiao Chen, who hadn’t said anything this whole time, finally opened his mouth. “Have you guys heard of scape/goats?” 

“Huh?” All the people stared at him.

“Where someone once drowned, there will often be others who also drown. Water monkeys will pull people into the water and suffocate them. In addition, the New Testament records that Jesus Christ was willing to be crucified on a cross as a sacrificial victim dedicated to God in order to atone for humans.” Xiao Chen grinned. “Commonly known as killing people to renew life!”

Everyone was slightly dazed by his serious expression. But they reacted swiftly, and Yuan Zhong wasn’t in the mood to joke. He really thought Xiao Chen was just playing around. “Xiao Chen, what nonsense are you saying? Right now, who f*cking has the time to joke?!”

Xiao Chen tilted his head. “I’m not kidding!” He blinked innocently. “You guys can go find some witches and ask them if this method can’t break this dead end.”

The old woman frowned, and her formerly impassive face stiffened. It wasn’t even an overstatement to describe her as terrified. Her lips had paled and she shook like she had seen something horrible. She twitched her lips and shouted, “Go! I cannot assist you!”

Wang Xing was shocked, and she recklessly grabbed the old woman’s hand. “Great master, help us! I know that your religious magic is very profound, and haven’t you saved many people before? Can you not save us this time?”

The old woman was so angry that she laughed. “Do you understand what kind of people I normally help? They are either exceedingly compassionate people without any sin, or they are good people who have reincarnated ten times. You really think that my religious magic is so advanced? I am only an ordinary person! Every single one of you is extremely sinful. How can I do anything?” 

Wang Xing had been scolded so much that her face had turned ugly. Her complexion was especially sallow when the woman mentioned that their sins were intense.

Yuan Zhong had wanted to speak for a long time. When he noticed that Wang Xing was dumbstruck, he directly came forward and asked, “Is the method of killing people and renewing life actually feasible?”

The old woman’s eyes widened, as if she hadn’t expected the other to say something like this. Her lips quivered as she murmured, “How do you know about that?”

Liang Jing appeared to have seized a key point. “So, it really works?”

The old woman was so frightened that she took a step back. She loudly yelled, “Quickly get out of my house, and don’t come again in the future! Leave! Quickly go!”

The moment the group was pushed to the door, the old woman’s gaze met with Xiao Chen’s. Horror emerged in her eyes, and she seemed to have seen something inconceivable. 

It wasn’t until the door was completely closed that she recovered. “What’s going on? He was actually stillborn? How did he survive?”



 “Look at this news!” Wang Xing’s dark circles were a bit heavy. She turned her phone so that the group could see the contents clearly. 

“This kind of case happened as early as 7 years ago. A woman claimed to foresee the future. When she got off the plane before it took flight, she brought an entire row of relatives who were planning to go to other places. And the plane hadn’t been in the air for more than ten minutes before it exploded and disintegrated! The survivors died one by one. This incident caught a lot of people’s attention at that time! Supposedly, there was a 12-year-old who managed to live!” Wang Xing briefly summarized the details as her eyes widened. 

Since someone lived in the end, did that mean they didn’t necessarily have to die? 

Liang Jing took the phone and more or less scanned through the whole article. He grew a little excited as well.

There were quite a few old photos in the article, but most of them were cut from surveillance videos. They weren’t very clear at all.

The last one was a photo of the boy who survived. He was expressionless, and he wore an extremely loose white T-shirt. It didn’t really fit him. A very fat woman tightly clutched his wrist, and she fixed her eyes on him. She seemed to be afraid that the other party would walk away and get lost!

Perhaps because his clothes were very large, the tattoo on the boy’s shoulder blade was exposed. However, its pattern couldn’t be discerned.

Yuan Zhong also reached for the phone. He frowned as he said, “But it doesn’t say what happened to the boy afterwards! What if he’s already dead?”

The atmosphere suddenly tensed.

Xiao Chen was standing behind Yuan Zhong. Yuan Zhong thought he also wanted to look at the phone, so he soon handed it over.

Xiao Chen flipped through the contents of the news with an indifferent expression. When he saw the last photo, he couldn’t help but squint. His hand unconsciously moved to his shoulder blade. 

Seven years ago…

He was 12 years old.

He would always remember this woman. She died right in front of him. He witnessed the whole process of a woman being hit by a car! And he just stood beside the road, watching everything motionlessly. There weren’t any fluctuations in his heart.

That woman was a human traff/icker. 

Later, he met that man.

In this world, there were never such things as precognitive dreams. There was no rebirth as well. It was only when the person the god of death wanted to protect was in danger, that he would weave a nightmare and send it to a survivor’s brain. He did that so they could bring the person he treasured away. 

This was the case seven years ago, and it continued all the way to the present. 

“Could it actually be that we can only find a scapegoat?” Wang Xing broke down. “How can I dare to kill someone?”

She really didn’t want to die!

Xiao Chen observed everyone’s desperate faces. He didn’t have the slightest bit of emotion as he lifted the corner of his mouth. “For a scape/goat, you don’t necessarily have to do the dirty work with your own hands.”

All the people in the room raised their heads and stared at Xiao Chen. There was a complicated look in their eyes. Although Xiao Chen appeared the same as usual, every time he said something, he would make them feel shocked. They wouldn’t be able to digest his words for a while.

But they already mostly believed in what he was saying. When he mentioned that he had some idea, they involuntarily held their breath.

“Have you guys heard of Kuman Thong?” Xiao Chen shrugged. “In Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, it is rather prevalent. It’s a kind of protector god similar to the Buddha.”

Everyone stared at him doubtfully. 

Xiao Chen snorted. “Commonly known as raising a child ghost.”

“It can keep people safe, help people get rich, and save your life when necessary!” Xiao Chen lowered his gaze. “I also heard that by using this method, sin and death can be grafted onto another person. As long as you believe in it, it can help you acquire a scapegoat!”

Wang Xing and Liang Jing looked at each other and swallowed.

“But isn’t this method very dangerous?” Wang Xing brought forward her own question. “Will there be any backlash against us?”

Xiao Chen turned towards Wang Xing and said calmly, “Danger is danger, but at least it’s better than waiting to die.”

“Not to mention, you only need to treat Kuman Thong well, like it’s your own child. This method will definitely be foolproof.”

A bit of maliciousness that was hard to detect flickered across Xiao Chen’s eyes.

Wang Xing frowned.

As her own child? How could she do that? That was too disgusting!

“Remember, raising a Kuman Thong requires a lot of attention. You must remember what I’m about to tell you! Elephants in Thailand are very sacred! Therefore, the people who wish to ask something of Kuman Thong must not have any ivory products. Wild animal products also can’t be used or eaten……” The man handed the Kuman Thong, which had the appearance of a golden boy, to Wang Xing. 

Wang Xing nodded carelessly, and her heart was in a mess. This man was from Thailand, and he was the daigou boss she found after exhausting a lot of effort. 

“And you have to remember to provide for it and sincerely worship it every day. The most basic thing you can give is clean water, and you can use snacks for food. But you can’t use raw meat, you…” The man seemed to want to say more, but Wang Xing was really too frightened. Besides, the man himself wasn’t that religious, and he couldn’t bring himself to enjoy this kind of thing. 

“Alright, alright, I know! I will search online if I have a question. This is the money for the Kuman Thong!” Wang Xing immediately planned to interrupt the man in the middle of his words. She tossed a black bag filled with money to him, and then hurriedly walked away. 

The man sighed as he watched Wang Xing leave.

The person raising the Kuman Thong couldn’t say they bought it. They could only say that they were inviting it. 

And…

The person raising the Kuman Thong had to have a kind-hearted temperament. Otherwise, there would be a good chance of backlash.

What a pity!

The man shook his head, collected the money, and left as well.

“Why did you become the god of death?” Xiao Chen began to trace the man’s face with his index finger, staring attentively at him.

“Born like this.” The man adjusted Xiao Chen’s sitting posture so that he could lie down more comfortably.

Asking that was like asking a person why they were a person, asking a woman why they were a woman, and asking a man why they were a man. 

Xiao Chen continued. “Will I die?”

The man was silent. His voice was hoarse as he said, “I won’t let you die.”

Xiao Chen smiled. “But one day, I will die. When I’m old and ugly, when my body fails me, there will be countless other cute boys. You will definitely not like me! At that time, I will still die.”

The man caressed the child’s hand, which was on his shoulder blade. He met Xiao Chen’s eyes. “There is no one else.” He paused, adding, “If you die, I will die with you.”

Everything had set laws. In good words, that meant he was in charge of the life and death of others. In bad words, that meant he only was the punisher for the people that had to go to hell. At the end of the day, this child would still die, even if he was the god of death. 

He was reluctant and unwilling.

Xiao Chen’s eyelids jumped, and he rested his head on the man’s shoulder. He seemingly casually said, “You can’t lie to me.”



 Wang Xing casually dropped the Kuman Thong onto the nightstand in her bedroom. Remembering that she had to give it some offerings, she turned towards the refrigerator and took out a piece of beef she had bought previously. She carelessly steamed it and placed it into a bowl when she was done. Afterwards, she put the bowl in front of Kuman Thong. 

Wang Xing glanced at Kuman Thong’s face, her chest tightening. She couldn’t help but frown, feeling a little disgusted.

When she looked around the room that was so large, she was reminded of Li Haibo and Yang Meili. Suddenly, she thought of something and panicked. She directly picked up her phone from the bed and dialed Liang Jing. Meanwhile, she also swiftly changed her clothes, planning to go out and meet him. 

She had just reached the front door when she abruptly recalled something. Once again, Wang Xing rushed back to her bedroom and grabbed the Kuman Thong, stuffing it into her pocket. 

Outside.

It was already very late, so there were almost no people walking on the streets. Several small shops were the only ones still open. The streetlights emitted a faint glow, but it was unlikely that they would be able to affect the surrounding darkness. 

Wang Xing was cautious with every step she took. Her eyes shifted left and right, fearing that she would encounter some sort of accident. 

She unconsciously walked alongside the outermost edge of the road. Although there were only a few deserted cars on it, she was quite frightened. 

There were no public buses during nighttime, and there weren’t even that many taxis. Luckily, the house Wang Xing rented was close to Liang Jing’s, and it didn’t really take a long time to walk between the two. 

“D*mn, move aside for this Laozi! Walking so slowly, are you looking for death?!” 

Wang Xing was dumbfounded as a man violently shoved her. Perhaps because she was originally feeling weak in her heart, she directly tumbled onto the ground. The Kuman Thong in her pocket fell out, letting out a “dong” sound.

Wang Xing hurriedly picked up the Kuman Thong and stood up, shaking unsteadily.

The man was walking very rapidly, and he soon broke into a run. He seemed to be a little hooligan, as his hair was dyed gold and his clothes had a □□ appearance.

Wang Xing suddenly realized something. She felt around in her pocket, only to discover that her phone had already been stolen!

She trembled with anger, wanting to chase after the man. But before she could advance, the scene in front of her eyes completely stunned her. 

“Boom!” There was a loud noise!

A red unlicensed car actually collided with the man! Its speed was extremely fast! The man’s head caved in as it was smashed into a bloody pulp. Wang Xing hadn’t even reacted when the car backed up again and repeatedly crushed the man! Afterwards, the car swiftly fled the scene. In the end, Wang Xing didn’t even know whether the driver was male or female. 

Although the lighting was poor in the area, Wang Xing could still vaguely see the blood flowing on the ground, as well as the man’s hands and feet. His mutilated flesh, which had been ground by the car’s tires, was visible. 

“AHHH!” A scream instantly erupted from somewhere nearby. The few people on this road had all seen what had happened. Wang Xing’s legs softened as she collapsed. Cold sweat poured from her.

If the man hadn’t pushed her, at her normal pace, wouldn’t she have been the one hit by the car when she arrived there? 

She thought of Xiao Chen’s words as her eyes involuntarily returned to the Kuman Thong in her hand. 

Was this really because of it?

“It really has an effect?” Liang Jing was somewhat surprised.

“En.” Wang Xing’s face was pale, and it seemed like she hadn’t recovered from the shock yet.

After listening to Wang Xing, Liang Jing was a bit excited. However, he quickly forced himself to calm down. “Let’s first call Yuan Zhong and Xiao Chen over here. If this is real, we won’t have to die!”

“That’s too great!” Yuan Zhong was thrilled. But after a while, he abruptly froze. He looked embarrassed as he worriedly asked, “How much did you buy this Kuman Thong for?”

Yuan Zhong’s family was extremely poor. Whenever possible, he would go and work in order to earn money. Usually, he lived frugally, unlike the other members of the club. They could rent a house close to the school, but Yuan Zhong actually lived in the school. Right now, it was too difficult for him to pull out a lot of money for some sort of toy like the Kuman Thong. On a normal occasion, he would never do that even if he was beaten to death. 

“Five thousand.” Wang Xing replied, revealing the price.

“What?” Yuan Zhong’s face immediately turned red. “So expensive?”

Wang Xing explained, “This can’t even be considered expensive! The good ones cost tens of thousands.”

“Not to mention, Kuman Thong doesn’t originate from China in the first place. If you’re a bit careless, you could purchase fake goods!” Wang Xing swallowed, feeling nauseous as her stomach churned. 

“But…” Yuan Zhong appeared like he wanted to respond.

Liang Jing couldn’t endure anymore. He interrupted the two, saying, “Look at how far the situation has progressed! You’re still thinking of money? Is money more important than your life?”

Yuan Zhong stopped talking, but his face was still a little stiff. 

“Alright, it’s good if it works. If nothing happens to you guys, I’ll be very happy.” Xiao Chen had been the background for a long time. At the right moment, he decided to join the conversation. But the tone of his voice was flat, and maybe even cold. On the other hand, Xiao Chen usually spoke like this, so everyone didn’t think it was strange.

Liang Jing couldn’t help but take a few peeks at Xiao Chen. He felt that the other would always change unpredictably. This feeling was too strong. Liang Jing had the sense that Xiao Chen knew everything, and was just playing with him like he was a mouse, nothing more than a toy. 

“Xiao Chen, how do you know so much?” Liang Jing couldn’t resist the temptation and brought forth this question. 

Instantly, everyone stared at Xiao Chen. 

They were all curious about the answer. 

“Maybe because my boyfriend is very proficient in this aspect,” Xiao Chen casually replied. He sat on a chair, flexing his toes. When he said the word “boyfriend”, he smiled weirdly. 

“Boyfriend? You…” Liang Jing choked. He completely hadn’t imagined that Xiao Chen was gay!

Wang Xing and Yuan Zhong were also astonished, but Wang Xing recovered in little time.

Indeed, Xiao Chen’s appearance was too outstanding! As a girl, she felt ashamed whenever she was compared with him. 

So when she heard Xiao Chen admit he had a boyfriend, she was mildly surprised, but not too shocked.

Yuan Zhong grasped the main point and said, “Your boyfriend understands these kinds of things? You already know so much! Then, could you ask your boyfriend to help us?”

“That’s fine!” Xiao Chen immediately agreed. He smiled, his pair of lucky phoenix eyes narrowing. “Next time, I’ll bring you guys to get acquainted with my boyfriend.”

Xiao Chen’s expression seemed innocent, but for some reason, a chill emerged in Liang Jing’s heart when he faced the other. 

“Is this real or fake? Is this thing so useful?” Yuan Zhong’s eyes glowed, but he soon frowned again. “But I need a Kuman Thong, not a Thai Buddha amulet.”

The boy rolled his eyes. “What’s the difference? Let me tell you, a Kuman Thong is made with a stillborn baby! This Thai Buddha amulet is made with the bone ashes of an adult and corpse oil! Haven’t you already realized which one has more power? Moreover! I had to plead with several people to acquire this! It’s a total of only one thousand, which is much cheaper than the Kuman Thong!”

Yuan Zhong thought that the boy made sense, but he was still hesitant.

“I’ll say this, there is no other shop like this one! If you don’t buy this amulet, I can easily sell it at a higher price. If I didn’t take into account that you’re my brother, I wouldn’t be here,” the boy impatiently said.

Yuan Zhong nodded, patting the boy’s shoulder. “Okay! I’ll buy it!” Afterwards, he pulled the money out of his pocket, his expression pained.

Once the boy received the money, he was instantly happy in his heart. He beamed as he said, “That’s good! If you want anything in the future, you can contact me!” Then, he left without looking back!

“Baby, let me tell you, I just met a fool today. Remember the Thai Buddha amulet I took from my uncle’s place last time? I sold it! It sold for a thousand!”

“Yes, yes! That one! Hai, what are you afraid of? In this modern age, you still believe in this? Don’t worry! No one will die! Even if someone dies, it isn’t possible that anything will happen to me.”

The boy energetically talked on the phone. 

The man held Xiao Chen in his embrace. A morbid, possessive desire flashed across his eyes. But he quickly suppressed himself and returned to calmness.

“Kiss me.” Xiao Chen was never shy about these things.

The man’s expression changed again. He bit Xiao Chen’s left ear, the veins on his forehead bulging as he tried to restrain his emotions. 

Eyebrows, nose, lips, jaw, Adam’s apple, collarbone…Every part was exceedingly delicious to him.

The man’s eyesight was very good. Even in the middle of the night, he could see everything around him without using a light source. 

Just like.

At this time, Xiao Chen wore a slightly □□ expression.

The man caressed Xiao Chen’s face and grinned.

This was his only treasure! His only reverse scale! 



 “This is your boyfriend?” Wang Xing was somewhat surprised. Her lips parted and her eyes widened.

Xiao Chen chuckled, turning around to look at the man. The other was no different from usual. He carried out his principle of dressing completely in black and having a simple hairstyle. He had masculine facial features, a hook nose, and a pair of gray pupils. He looked exceedingly like a mixed-race person. 

“That’s right, isn’t my boyfriend handsome?” Xiao Chen held the man’s hand as they sat down on the sofa. 

But Liang Jing, who was standing at the side, was a bit impatient. He quickly came up and faced the man. Probably because he wanted to jump straight to the main topic, he said, “Do you really understand a lot about the god of death?”

The man’s gaze didn’t waver, and his expression remained unchanged. “En.”

“Can the Kuman Thong actually save us?”

Liang Jing was a little suspicious. He had always felt that something like this sort of sorcery wouldn’t be too good. 

Yesterday, he had pleaded with someone in order to buy a Kuman Thong. But he had remained very careful and later asked a great master. He discovered that there were some dangers in using a Kuman Thong. 

Astonishingly, the formerly expressionless man curved the corner of his mouth. “Have you heard of Sisyphus?”

“What?” Liang Jing frowned. The man’s smile made him uncomfortable.

“In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was the son of Aeolus, the god of winds.” Xiao Chen lifted his head and explained, “In mythology, he once wanted to kidnap the god of death. His goal was for the world to be free of death. And because he didn’t fulfill his agreement with the god of death, his deception led to his punishment of pushing a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll down again when he neared the top.”

Wang Xing unconsciously blinked. Although the man’s gaze never fell on her, whenever she moved a little closer to him, she would experience an inexplicable chill which penetrated her bones.

“What does that mean?” Yuan Zhong’s face appeared quite healthy. There wasn’t a trace of his anxiousness from a few days ago. In fact, he could be described as energetic if it weren’t for his feeble walking pace. 

“It means,” Xiao Chen began as he tilted his head. “No one can fool the god of death.”

You can be luckily rescued again and again, but the god of death can continue to punish sinners until they die.

Xiao Chen scanned everyone sitting in the room.

Liang Jing choked and hastily asked, “Is there no other way?”

“Atonement.” The man had reverted to his initial indifference. Only when he touched Xiao Chen would there be a hint of gentleness in his eyes. 

The expressions of the three other people briefly cracked. They looked at each other, a tense atmosphere enveloping their surroundings. 

“What?” Wang Xing exclaimed in shock.

The man didn’t reply, and Xiao Chen didn’t explain. He just smiled at them.

He pulled the man up and planned to go out. Suddenly, Yuan Zhong said, “We still don’t know his name yet!”

The man paused.

Xiao Chen turned around and said, “You can call him Colby.” Then, he left without looking back.

Colby, someone who comes from darkness. 

In the Bible, limited atonement didn’t exist. Even the Lamb of God, who took away the sin of the world, was eventually crucified. His spilt blood washed away the sin. Without bloodshed, it would never have been pardoned.

There is only one way to atone.

“So annoying! Laozi has already been buying lottery tickets for three or four years now, and I haven’t won once! Sh*t!” The boy ran his hand through his hair. Then, he tore the lottery ticket he had purchased into shreds. He grabbed a cigarette from the table and started to smoke. He was in an irritable mood as he depressingly smoked by himself. Eventually, he walked out of the bedroom. 

Yuan Zhong glanced at the back of the boy and snorted.

In this year, who would believe that they could win the lottery?

Yuan Zhong wiped his hair and was about to sit down. Abruptly, he remembered that he had bought a random ticket when he helped the boy a few days ago. 

For some reason, he rifled through his drawer and pulled out his wallet. When he saw the one-inch photo of a girl in the slit of his wallet, he couldn’t help but be nervous.

There was no money in the wallet. It only contained this picture and a Thai Buddha amulet.

He carefully compared the numbers written on the notebook by the boy.

“Thump, thump.” Yuan Zhong’s heartbeat suddenly accelerated.

The first numbers were the same.

The second…

The third…

Yuan Zhong’s hands began to tremble.

The last one!! He glanced at the winning number and then at his lottery ticket.

His face, which was originally exhilarated, instantly cooled.

“F*ck!” Yuan Zhong yelled.

“Atonement…” Liang Jing kept muttering this word with an ugly expression.

Wang Xing said with difficulty, “That time…”

Liang Jing stiffened, but he didn’t rebuke her. 

“Should the two of us go and find that girl’s family?” Wang Xing lowered her head, pain evident in her voice.

Liang Jing’s expression changed. “What are you saying? Do you think they will let us go? Do you want to go to jail?”

Wang Xing stopped talking for a moment and was silent.

She had never forgotten that day.

That day, she and Liang Jing had drunk some alcohol. Later, they drove in an unlicensed car on a section of the road that was unmonitored. The driver was Liang Jing, but the car was hers. 

After hitting that girl, they hurriedly ran away. 

They lived in a state of fear for a couple of months. 

When they were sure that the police wouldn’t come knocking on their doors, they agreed to never bring this matter up for the rest of their life.

Who could have guessed that things would change?

“What should we do then?” Wang Xing was increasingly anxious.

Although it was true that the Kuman Thong had saved her life, would it protect her forever?

Liang Jing didn’t say anything.

“Ding.” A text message arrived.

Liang Jing took out his phone. But when he saw the contents of the message, he was horrified.

Wang Xing was puzzled. “What’s wrong?” She moved closer to him to look at the message. However, it left her completely dumbfounded. 

It was sent by an anonymous person.

The photo was set late at night, with no streetlights in the background. But it remained surprisingly clear, and it was obvious that the focus was a black car in the center. The body of a girl who had been crushed lay near the rear of the car. The photo was shot at an unbiased angle, but it just happened to perfectly capture the people in the front seats——they really were Liang Jing and Wang Xing.

“How is this possible?” Cold sweat poured from Wang Xing, and her voice quivered.

Weren’t the police even unable to reveal a suspect? Who sent this to them?

Liang Jing’s hand twitched, and the phone directly fell onto the ground.

“Clatter.” There was another message.

Liang Jing’s face twisted. He forced himself to pick up his phone. After he read the message, his heart sank. 

‘Your sin will eventually come back and find you.’

Signed, God of Death. 

Wang Xing seized the phone. Her eyes widened, and tears were squeezed out from the corners of her eyes. “What should we do? What should we do? I don’t want to die! I really don’t want to die! I don’t want to go to jail!!”

Everything that seemed to be a coincidence was actually a piece of the god of death’s plans. This included each sinner’s time of death, place of death, their next actions, and every instance in which they had the delusion of being saved. Perhaps, even the sins committed by the sinners were only a part of his plan.

“Come and sit in my arms.” The man raised a corner of his mouth and stared at Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen was like a pile of soft bones as he climbed into the man’s lap and wrapped his arms around the other’s neck.

“Your courage was really impressive today.” The man stroked Xiao Chen’s hair.

“Oh.” Xiao Chen blinked, looking very innocent.

The man observed him and couldn’t help but tighten his grasp. His eyes slightly narrowed with a hint of danger.

Then, he carefully placed Xiao Chen’s head on his chest. “Sleep. I will hold you.”

This was the sole light in the tens of thousands of years of his existence.

Xiao Chen obediently closed his eyes.

The man’s hand stopped at Xiao Chen’s shoulder blade. Further up was Xiao Chen’s neck, the most vulnerable part of his body. As long as he exerted the slightest force, this child would die.

He quietly sat in the dark night, holding the person firmly in his arms.

He was the god of death, a demon, the Devil. He wasn’t any sort of kind person. He symbolized evil and was undoubtedly born with original sin.

He was jealous, jealous of everyone who came in contact with this child. Even if it was just one glance, one sentence, it would drive him crazy.

But he pretended to be very good in front of this child. He kept controlling his desires! He feared that he would scare the other!

He would even swallow Xiao Chen into his stomach so that he would become a part of himself!

In this way, no one would be able to steal Xiao Chen’s attention from him!

How unfair! There was only Xiao Chen in his world, but he wasn’t the only one in Xiao Chen’s world.

His fingers traced Xiao Chen’s face. Xiao Chen had already fallen asleep, but he unconsciously wrinkled his nose and hugged the man closer.

The man was pleased.

Never! Never leave me!

No one! Can deceive the god of death!


 Yuan Zhong lay in bed, staring at the ceiling in a daze. Abruptly, he remembered something and sat up. He pulled out a one-inch photo of a girl from his wallet and held it in the palm of his hand. He involuntarily pursed his lips.

The girl in the photo didn’t look that old. In fact, she seemed a bit like a high school student. Her braided hair and the absence of makeup on her face gave her a neat and refreshing appearance. This photo had obviously been around for quite a while. But though its edges were faded, it was well-preserved as a whole.

Yuan Zhong absentmindedly stared at the photo, his eyes a little wet.

“Xinxin.” He said this with a pained expression.

“Why?” Yuan Zhong clenched his teeth. Deep in his heart, he harbored a monstrous grievance. 

Zhou Xinxin was his girlfriend, his first love.

The two of them grew up together. They went to the same elementary school, middle school, and high school. If it weren’t for that accident, they would have attended the same university and worked at the same place.

But her studies ceased in her second year of high school, and her life was stuck forever at the age of 18.

Twice! He was unable to save her!

Could it be that even when she died, she still hated him?

Yuan Zhong suddenly thought of something and curled up into a ball. He buried his head into a pillow and silently weeped.

If he were just a little more courageous and simply stayed by her side when she needed him, nothing would have happened!

The last time he saw her was when her body had already lost all of its temperature. Even her blood was ice-cold! 

Since she had been crushed by a car, the bones in her hands were broken.

What was even more ridiculous was that to this day, he still hadn’t found the murderer who hit her. It had been so long! He didn’t know who had harmed her in their second year of high school!

Now, he was also facing the threat of death.

A layer of black mist slowly wrapped around Yuan Zhong’s head, permeating his surroundings.

In a corner he couldn’t see, a man wearing a black robe stood there and watched his every move. There wasn’t the slightest trace of warmth in his eyes. Soon, in the blink of an eye, he vanished into thin air. 

The next one is you.

“All of the god of death’s actions have a purpose.” Liang Jing read the sentence on his phone aloud, his expression a bit stiff.

This book was called “Theory of the God of Death”. It was written during the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Later, superstition was suppressed and this book was naturally banned.

He discovered it in a group for people who believed in the supernatural. It could only be downloaded as an electronic version from a certain website. There wasn’t even a physical copy, let alone any research done.

And in this book, the author separated death into three types. The first type was the god of death’s form of death, the second type was natural death, and the last type was coincidental death. 

Natural death meant passing away peacefully, while accidental death meant an unnatural death interwoven with chance. If it was illness, an accident, or even coincidence, there was a possibility of survival. 

But the god of death’s form of death was different. This death was absolute, and it was reserved as retribution for those with grave sins. The god of death wouldn’t rest until he eliminated the ones rejected by the Way of Heaven. 

Wang Xing was anxious. “Does the book really not mention a method we can use to save ourselves?”

After being rescued by the Kuman Thong that time, she had started to constantly give offerings to it. She would bring it with her wherever she went. And every day, she would provide incense and prepare good fish meat. 

In the beginning, everything was okay. Not only did she stop encountering any more dangerous accidents, but her luck also began to overflow. Anything she did was very successful. But just as she was thinking that she had shaken off the threat of death, for many nights in a row, she vaguely sensed that there was a child making a racket by her side. Then, her luck turned even worse than before. 

“No.” Liang Jing shook his head, clutching the position of his heart with his right hand. His expression was ugly.

In order to live, the two of them had frantically been doing charity work. They had already spent all of their money. Since they were students, they simply didn’t have enough of it in the first place. 

They were living with each other now. Together, they had hidden all the dangerous things in the room. Even the corners of the tables had been covered with bumper strips. To minimize safety hazards, they ordered takeout for their meals and skipped classes for several days. 

If this went on any longer, even if they didn’t die, they would be driven insane.

Liang Jing grit his teeth. Was he reborn just for the sake of dying again? In his dreams every night, he could still feel the pain and horror of weightlessly falling off a cliff!! Who would cherish their life more than someone who had already died once?

“Why haven’t you gone out recently?” Xiao Chen placed his bare feet on the floor as he slouched on top of a sofa stool. His head was tilted back, revealing his protruding Adam’s apple. Both of his eyes were open and fixed on the man sitting behind him. 

The man’s life was very dull. He didn’t have any sort of entertainment. Even when Xiao Chen lay on the sofa and watched TV, he wasn’t interested in joining. He always sat on the side without an expression, intently focused on Xiao Chen’s every move.

His brow furrowed as he observed Xiao Chen. An image seemed to flash across his mind.

The scene in front of him gave him a faint sense of deja vu. 

“I just want to accompany you.” The man’s eyes narrowed, carrying a hint of morbidness. 

“Oh.” Xiao Chen swung his legs happily. He liked to listen to the man’s affectionate words.

“Senior! Where are you?”

The man was startled. Intense pain shot through his head.

“How is this possible? All passersby must leave traces! Why can’t I find him?!”

“Senior!! Where did you go?”

More scenes emerged in the man’s head as the hysterical roars stimulated his nerves.

The images were confusing. He couldn’t clearly discern that person’s face.

He squinted involuntarily. Then, he directed his gaze towards the back of Xiao Chen’s head. For some reason, he suddenly stood up and moved forwards. 

Xiao Chen doubtfully watched as the man hugged him by the waist. He poked the other’s cheek with his index finger as he lay in a princess carry. “What’s up with you?”

“Really good, I can still hold you,” the man said absentmindedly. 

Xiao Chen smiled and kissed the corner of the man’s mouth.

The man didn’t speak, but he tightened his grasp on Xiao Chen.

He was inexplicably afraid, afraid that the child would leave him. He would never allow that!

These emotions were too strong, to the point that he felt unsatisfied even with Xiao Chen in his arms. Plus, his own inner demons had long caused him to go mad. He completely couldn’t accept the thought of losing Xiao Chen. Now, he practically had no way of concealing his crazy possessiveness. 

He was sick and incurable. He couldn’t save himself.

The man’s necklace rubbed against Xiao Chen’s neck, causing the latter to move in discomfort.

As a result, he could only bury his head in Xiao Chen’s neck.

He had a secret. He had never told Xiao Chen about it, and Xiao Chen would never know what it was.

An angel could kill the one they loved for the sake of the whole world! But a demon could kill the whole world for the one they loved.

You don’t need to know many people I killed for you. 



Chapter 25

 “Brother Zhong, I’m going to be expelled!” Zhou Xinxin took out a pregnancy test from her pocket. Her eyes were swollen and an eye-catching bright red. She was pale and seemed to be talking to herself. “What should I do?” 

Yuan Zhong was livid. “I told you to stop wearing revealing skirts! Otherwise, how could this kind of thing happen?! Who can you blame now that you’re like this?” 

Zhou Xinxin’s expression worsened when she heard his words. She didn’t speak as she stuffed the pregnancy test back into her pocket. 

How many times had she ended up in this situation? Why was she always criticized even though she was clearly the true victim? Her friends looked at her as if she were a fierce flood or a savage beast! She didn’t know how many people mocked her behind her back. This was the case both at school and at home. Even her relatives, parents, and everyone else pointed at her and swore! They laughed at her as if she deserved it! 

She was despicable enough to seduce her own cousin! 

Why? Was it only because she was a girl? Just because she was good-looking, she deserved to be hurt when she wore a short skirt? 

Zhou Xinxin’s father obviously knew who had done this to her. But he was bribed by that person and concealed this incident. He used the money he had received to make sure that her younger brother was set for life. Then, he also warned her that she wasn’t allowed to reveal that person’s name! 

How funny! 

Zhou Xinxin’s face was cold. Just as she was intending to leave, a burned out Yuan Zhong abruptly grabbed her hand. He anxiously said, “Give me a day. I’ll gather enough money. Later in the week, I’ll take you to get rid of this child.” 

Zhou Xinxin looked at him expressionlessly and said, “You’re truly a man, Yuan Zhong!” 

Yuan Zhong suddenly opened his eyes. He was covered in cold sweat and his whole body felt clammy. His clothes were tightly glued to his skin, making him uncomfortable. 

He sat up with some effort and used his hands to support his head. The dizziness he was experiencing was almost enough for him to collapse. He could only pant heavily in order to relieve some of the pain. 

It was this dream again! 

Yuan Zhong exhaled laboriously. He endured the discomfort as he nimbly pulled himself up. His movements were extremely light, and he didn’t disturb the others sleeping in the room. 

For some reason, there was a depressing atmosphere in the room. Yuan Zhong couldn’t explain it. His chest was stuffy, to the point that he found it difficult to breathe. 

His surroundings were bathed in darkness, seeming a bit weird. He had never felt this way before. Even his roommate, who lay asleep on a bed, looked increasingly like a corpse in a morgue. 

In this incomparably tranquil night, the clock hanging on the wall let out an unexpected noise, shattering the calmness. But Yuan Zhong couldn’t even see the numbers on the clock. 

“Hiss.” Yuan Zhong took a deep breath and quietly swore. “D*mn.” 

Someone had placed a pile of books next to his bed. Yuan Zhong was planning to stand up, but when he lowered his foot, his toe collided with the books. 

Yuan Zhong used his right hand to hold a cigarette between his index finger and middle finger. He skillfully lit it and exhaled, watching as the smoke circled around in the air. 

His mind began to scatter. 

In this life, there were two things he was ashamed of. 

First, he couldn’t protect Zhou Xinxin. He let her be bullied, and didn’t even find the murderer who had hit her with a car. 

Second, in order to collect money for her abortion, he stole ten thousand in cash from a limping uncle. 

If he had known that there was so much money in that bag, Yuan Zhong definitely wouldn’t have chosen him. 

Having said that, this was merely a case of fifty paces laughing at one hundred paces. 

But he had neither the courage to return the money, nor the courage to spend all of it. 

After close to the time it took an incense stick to burn, Yuan Zhong dropped the cigarette butt onto the ground and stepped on it twice. His face remained indifferent. 

As he gazed into the pitch black darkness around him, his chest tightened further. But soon, he adjusted his mood and slowly crawled back into bed. 

It was as if an enchantment spell had been cast upon him. In only half of the time it took an incense stick to burn, Yuan Zhong fell into a deep sleep of death. 

“Whoosh.” A gust of wind blew by. 

The cigarette butt that had been previously crushed was ignited again. As it was moved by the wind, it actually fell onto a textbook someone had casually thrown onto the ground. 

And at this moment, the hands of the clock all pointed towards four… 

Did you know? A single spark can start a huge blaze. 

Danger always arrives inadvertently. 

“The school was burned down?” Liang Jing stared at his phone. The school authorities had sent out a notification message, and its contents left Liang Jing involuntarily with his mouth wide open. 

This was especially true when he saw that a boy surnamed Yuan died on the spot, while two others were injured. He instantly covered his mouth and nose, his mental state disorderly. 

Liang Jing was disgusted for a while. Strangely, in his mind, several images emerged out of thin air. It was just like he was given special close-up shots of a movie. 

In the pictures, he saw a corpse. Or more precisely, the heap of charred bones that remained of it. A mass of unknown black substance disgustingly clung to the bones. It appeared to be a human’s internal organs, and the rest of the body’s insides had completely burned to nothing. 

Yuan Zhong! 

As the images flashed across his mind, Liang Jing was dumbfounded. He was completely unable to recover from his shock. 

Liang Jing’s hands began to tremble, and his eyes were bloodshot. 

What was going on? Shouldn’t it have been Wang Xing? How did it directly become Yuan Zhong? 

Then, wouldn’t the next one be himself? 

Liang Jing’s breaths sped up. He abruptly remembered Xiao Chen’s theory of scapegoats and the fact that Wang Xing had witnessed someone die in front of her in an accident. 

Could it be? 

Scapegoats really were useful? 

So now, Wang Xing had actually been successfully rescued? The god of death had let her go? 

Liang Jing’s lips twitched, and a hint of anxiousness rose up within him. 

He certainly didn’t want to die! 

Who? Who could die for him?! 

It was at this moment that he suddenly thought of someone! 

Every night, old waste pickers would come to the neighborhood, rummage through the garbage, and collect the refuse. 

They were just beggars, black children, helpless people, and old men who went about by themselves. If one of them died, who would know? 

Liang Jing’s hands were clenched into fists. His gaze was chilly as he fiercely stared at Wang XIng. 

Wang Xing was startled by the look in his eyes. “What’s wrong?” 

“The two of us share a destiny. Now, we absolutely cannot sit back and await death!” Liang Jing stressed each and every word. His tone was slightly threatening as he said, “If you don’t want to die, just obediently listen to me!” 

The limping old man walked slowly. Countless wrinkles marred his face. They crowded together in folds of yellow, waxy skin. His face was covered in senile warts, and his eyes were sunken. He carried a trash bag, which was larger than his whole frame, on his rickety back. Inside the bag, there were broken scraps of water bottles, drink cans, iron wires, etc. 

“Uncle!” Liang Jiang called out. He lifted the corners of his mouth, but just enough to show the old man that he had good intentions. 

The other turned his head with difficulty to peer at Liang Jing. 

“Do you accept waste? I have a lot of it in my house. Would you like it?” Liang Jing stepped towards the old man and used his hands to support the trash bag on the elder’s back. He donned a humble and fawning appearance. 

The old man swiftly evaded. “Young man, no worries, no worries.” 

“Where is your home? I’ll help you carry your stuff to it. Later, come to my house to collect more rubbish.” 

Liang Jing’s voice wasn’t too loud and he enunciated every word. But somehow, though it was concealed well, there was a trace of panic when he spoke. 

The old man couldn’t stop Liang Jing, so he gave up and nodded his head. 

Along the way, Liang Jing chatted with him. “Are you living alone? What about your family? Are you a local? Why haven’t I seen you before?” 

The old man’s eyelids jumped and he hunched his back even more. “It has been years since my wife died from cancer! We originally had a girl, but a few days ago…” His heavy foreign accent was entirely unlike the local dialect. He didn’t finish his sentence, but one could already understand his meaning. “It was just in Yu Hua Neighborhood!” 

Liang Jing’s expression changed. A frightening conjecture suddenly appeared in his mind. His lips quivered as he asked, “What, what is your daughter’s name?” 

Tears formed in the corners of the elder’s eyes. “Meili, my daughter’s name is Yang Meili! This child suffered greatly! She sacrificed too much for this family in high school. Unexpectedly, in university, this sort of misfortune befell her.” 

Liang Jing’s face immediately darkened. 

How could this be so coincidental? 

The old man began to mumble. “Everything is my fault! If I had been more careful back then, the money wouldn’t have been stolen. If she had received treatment, this child’s mother wouldn’t have been forced to endure the late stages of cancer! This child is so foolish! Foolish! How could she think of making money in that way?” 

The old man shook his head as he recalled those painful memories. His expression worsened and he didn’t continue to speak. 

Liang Jing’s hands started to shake. He had the look of someone who owed millions. His eyes subconsciously lowered, and he bit his lip until it paled. He suppressed the turbulent and surging waves in his heart, forcing himself to calm down. 

It didn’t matter whose father the old man was! Was that as important as his own life? 

Liang JIng tightly clenched his teeth, causing the muscles in his cheek to twitch. 

I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die!! 

“What happened afterwards? Did the little prince end up with the rose?” Xiao Chen was lying on the bed, attentively listening to the man’s story. 

The man closed the book. “No.” 

When he saw the child lower his head in dejection, he added, “Later, that rose met a snake. It fell in love with the rose and didn’t mind the thorns on the other’s body. Even if the rose was damaged, the snake stayed by its side and guarded it.” 

The man placed his hand on Xiao Chen’s shoulder blade and seemed to have thought of something. “Finally, the rose and the snake lived together happily.” 


    Case File, 1 The God Of Death Is Coming

In the midsummer night, Wang Xing couldn’t help but shudder. She felt cold as she wore a disposable black mask to cover her nose and mouth and was dressed in all black clothing. 

There were a lot of flying insects at night, and from time to time, several of them would suddenly rush in front of her, even poking her in the eye.

Liang Jing was digging a pit with a shovel. His entire body looked cold. Wang Xing, standing next to him, was in a trance: Why does this man seem so strange?

There were two particularly large black garbage bags on the ground. The mouths of the bags were tightly tied, and when you got close enough, you could smell the rotting meat, especially in this weather, where it only takes a day for meat to rot. The unpleasant smell even attracted ants looking for food.

Despite the tight stranglehold of the two garbage bags, some of the sticky stuff inside still came out, looking disgustingly like animal guts. 

Wang Xing kind of wanted to vomit but managed to endure. She didn’t even dare to act rashly and wished to shrink her presence.

After the pit was dug most of the way, Liang Jing looked coldly at the now trembling Wang Xing next to him and withdrew his gaze. He didn’t care whether she made a move or not. As long as she was involved in this matter, their fates are tied together. No one will be better off!

Wang Xing’s brain was full of thoughts. She had no idea when exactly Liang Jing had killed anyone, let alone who he had killed. This feeling of the unknown intensified her panic.

“Hand me the bag.” Liang Jing suddenly issued with a commanding tone, directly startling her and interrupting her train of thought.

Wang Xing returned to her senses, staggered two steps, and handed the plastic bag to him hurriedly.

However, even with her gloves on, when her hands touched the black bag, the slippery and somewhat stiff feel made her whole body feel numb.

It’s a corpse! A mutilated corpse!

Her breathing was somewhat unmistakably chaotic. 

What a cruel way of death was this? And be chopped up?

Liang Jing couldn’t figure out what she was thinking and didn’t have time to guess. He was breaking out in a cold sweat, his fingers stiffening as he continued the same bending motion.

Finally.

His eyes were rid of fear and were more ecstatic. 

Finally, a scapegoat!

He finally doesn’t have to die!!!

“Do you remember the first time the two of us met?” Xiao Chen lay in the man’s arms and suddenly tilted his head, his gaze falling on the man.

“Hmm?” The man’s voice was soft. 

“I saw you.” Xiao Chen hooked his lips, “You were standing right across the road, and I saw you first!”

Despite the chaos of the surrounding area, the crowd screaming and noisy, and the cars parked rampantly around, all peace was disrupted by the sudden car accident. However, this man was like a traveler who had been alone for ten thousand years, as motionless as a stake, looking at the world with an expressionless face. Even if the world around him was disturbed, it could not change his expression.

Most importantly, he could tell at a glance that no one could see the man but himself.

The man chuckled lightly, not knowing what flashed through his mind, and touched Xiao Chen’s head, “Mm.” 

But it wasn’t the first glance he had, the one that could have made him willing to fall into hell. Since then, there had been only one person in his eyes from beginning to end.

The man narrowed his eyes as if he was caught up in some memory.

Xiao Chen’s fate was too strong. As a life that died prematurely, the Heavenly Dao always seemed to intentionally or unintentionally arrange all sorts of natural deaths around him, trying to erase this existence.

Whether seven years ago or now, the so-called survivors who are beloved by the God of Death are merely the tools of the God of Death to counteract the ways of Heaven and protect his beloved. 

The little girl who was supposed to die in that car accident survived by a fluke because the pattern was disrupted.

The subject of the car accident was also naturally grafted to the woman who had gotten the prophetic dream to escape a plane accident.

The little girl’s existence changed the pattern once again, affecting the five unrelated people, Li Haibo, Yang Meili, Yuan Zhong, Liang Jing, and Wang Xing.

“He hurt his cousin, and that girl killed herself.” Those were the exact words he’d said to the child. 

The man quirked his lips.

Chuckling, fake, it was just an excuse he used to coax the child.

Li Haibo harmed Zhou Xinxin and committed adultery; Yuan Zhong committed theft to raise money to help Zhou Xinxin get an abortion, and even passed the crime on to Yang Meili, compounding the crime; Yang Meili, to raise funds for her mother’s medical treatment, killed the baby in the womb that already had consciousness; Liang Jing and Wang Xing were drunk driving without a license, hit and killed Zhou Xinxin then fled, committing the crime of murder.

All of the seemingly unrelated people are linked together and guilty of a crime because of the same person. 

And Zhou Xinxin’s destiny had returned to the initial destination.

And the fundamental source of these crimes was Xiao Chen.

If he wanted to fill these vacancies and conform to the law, he would have to wipe them all out and minimize Xiao Chen’s influence to protect him.

The man narrowed his eyes with a dangerous look in them. 

This wasn’t the first time, and it would never be the last. He wouldn’t mind doing this a million times, as long as it was for the sake of the child.

Have you heard the story of the praying mantis that eats the husband?

When the female mantis is in a state of high hunger, the male mantis sacrifices himself to become food for the female mantis.

The man didn’t mind being such a male praying mantis for Xiao Chen. 

Xiao Chen’s hand restlessly began to pull the man’s hair and touched the man’s face. After a pause, Xiao Chen asked, somewhat sullenly, “Are you not going to get old?”

Like an immortal witch who can only watch her loved ones grow old and die while she stays young forever.

As if sensing that the child was not in the right mood, he immediately explained, “No, my face is just skin and can change,” the man added, “I’ll grow old with you.”

Xiao Chen blinked, looked at the man’s elite-looking face, suddenly laughed, and said, “Then can you become just as big as me.” 

The man’s face was estimated to be thirty years old, and his appearance hadn’t changed since their first encounter.

The man didn’t say anything, his gaze fixed on Xiao Chen’s eyes. His grey eyes were full of intoxicated obsession as it reflected Xiao Chen’s figure.

This was his greatest treasure.

Under Xiao Chen’s gaze, the man’s appearance changed at a visible rate, and his whole body looked younger and younger; even his skin began to become radiant. The eyes were still grey, and the nose was still hawkish, but for some reason, it was as if Xiao Chen’s nerves had been stimulated by something, and his whole body froze. 

He usually had this very subtle feeling when he looked at a man’s face, like a bone-deep sense of having watched and loved this face all his life.

And right now, seeing the man like this was incredibly intense!

Then, under the man’s gaze, Xiao Chen’s face quickly exploded red.

“You like me like this.” The man grasped Xiao Chen’s hand in his, with a bit of teasing. 

“I don’t! I don’t! Don’t be ridiculous!” Xiao Chen was furious and broke away from the man’s hand, looking a little ashamed.

Remember, as long as it’s you!

I’ll do anything for you!

Everything will be just as you want it! 

My Love.



The old man was a little thin, but his back was straight. He sat quietly on a small bench, wearing a proper robe and a black sunglass. 

In front of him was a particularly plain and clean wooden table that looked years old, and even the corners were somewhat chipped. There were even many deep and shallow textures on the table. There were not many things on the table, just a jar of bamboo sticks and a paper book with the word “Fortune Telling” written on it.

Many people were walking on this road, but few looked at him with half an eye; most of them walked away without looking. After all, these days, few people believe in fortune-telling.

The old man didn’t care and seemed to have gotten used to it. He quietly stared ahead with his glasses on. It was half a day of looking, eating, coming back, and continuing to sit, not knowing what he was holding on to.

“Young man, stay.” The old man stared ahead and suddenly spoke. 

Liang Jing and Wang Xing both paused and looked at each other. They had no intention of paying attention to him and prepared to leave.

“What bad luck have you two touched lately?” The old man didn’t change his face, his two hands resting on his legs.

Liang Jing couldn’t help but look back at him and walked over, “You mean us?”

“Yeah.” The old man nodded his head.

Wang Xing looked at the old man nervously.

Liang Jing was still a little wary, “Tell me, what bad luck have we touched.”

The old man’s brow furrowed slightly, “You have offended the God of Death.”

Liang Jing froze in his tracks, exchanged a glance back at the shocked Wang Xing, and continued to ask, “What’s the solution to that?” 

The old man was about to say something, but it felt like his throat was blocked by something, and he couldn’t say a word. He slowly turned his head, his gaze stopped sharply at the corner of the street, and he didn’t know what he saw. His entire state instantly withered, and his body wasn’t as straight as it had been at the beginning.

It was probably because the change in the old man was so evident that it caused Liang Jing and Wang Xing to look at the spot where the old man was looking, but the result was that there was no one there.

The old man looked a little stiff but finally waved his hand and stood up, intending to gather his things, as if he was leaving, “You go, I don’t know, I’m just a fortune teller.”

Liang Jing frowned but didn’t say anything. His original respectful look instantly became somewhat contemptuous. 

He thought the man was a great immortal, but he turned out to be nothing more than a fake.

It had been more than half a month since that day he killed the scapegoat. During that time, the bad luck he had touched had instantly evaporated, and he even had better luck than he had usually had before.

However, this was only limited to Liang Jing. On the contrary, Wang Xing’s physical state was getting worse, like a person whose blood was getting sucked out. She was getting more depressed day by day, and her body was also losing weight at a visible speed.

Initially, Wang Xing could be considered a beautiful woman, with a tall, thin, and very material body, but now she was not only getting shriveled up, but even her cheeks were starting to sink in. Her appetite was also getting bigger, but the strange thing was, the more she ate, the hungrier she got. Her stomach was like a bottomless pit, and no matter how much she tried to fill it up and drink Chinese medicine, it didn’t give her a feeling of fullness. 

But apart from that, Wang Xing’s life was back to how it had been in the beginning, and it seemed as if all was well for years.

The old man grasped the blind man’s cane, held the chair with one hand, and without looking back, he began to walk forward at a pace as fast as if there was some flood behind him.

His Adam’s apple rolled.

The eyes under the glasses were still filled with fear and alarm that hadn’t gone away after the shock. 

That person,

Was it the God of Death?

Liang Jing scowled and looked at Wang Xing indifferently, with a bit of threat in his tone, “Let’s go.”

Wang Xing nodded her head, her entire body becoming a little timid. 

She was afraid of Liang Jing…

The two of them were now almost inseparable. Even at school, when she had to go to the bathroom, he would wait for her at the door to come out. All of her clothes and necessities were also packed and sent to Liang Jing’s rented room. Just like Siamese(conjoined) twins, they were inseparable.

People thought it was love between lovers, but Wang Xing knew that wasn’t the case.

Liang Jing was putting her under house arrest in disguise! 

Her phone was checked regularly every day. She was utterly devoid of any personal space, she couldn’t speak to anyone around her, and she couldn’t show any unwillingness to do so.

Wang Xing subconsciously touched her wrist. She was still wearing a long-sleeved shirt on such a hot day. There was no other reason; it was because, underneath the clothes, there were traces of abuse.

If she resisted, she would be beaten by Liang Jing!

The current Liang Jing was no longer the Liang Jing she knew! 

But she didn’t dare resist! She’s too scared! She’s also an accomplice!

It was like she was suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, fearing him while relying on him.

“Eat.” The man had a cold face, and his eyes were glued to Xiao Chen, who had been lying on the couch for three hours and was still playing games.

Xiao Chen was lying on the sofa, with a cushion under his chest and elbows straining to support his entire upper body. He was wearing a rather large T-shirt, but it couldn’t hide his thin and narrow waist. His buttocks were somewhat curved, directly presenting an S visual effect. Xiao Chen only wore socks, and his little feet kept spinning in the air, looking particularly lazy. 

Hearing the man’s tone with the warm anger that was usually rare, Xiao Chen instantly behaved himself and withdrew his phone. He rolled in a small arc on the sofa and mumbled, “You bring it here, I don’t want to move.”

The man, who had always indulged him, put the child’s favorite dish in the bowl and walked straight over to the child.

Xiao Chen took the bowl and got up, leaving a space for the man, and patted the sofa to signal the man to sit down.

The man stared at the child, who was eating, without saying a word. 

Death doesn’t have to eat, but the child is different. He could learn the eighteen martial arts he couldn’t even use for the child and conveniently take care of all the child’s daily necessities.

He doesn’t mind if the child becomes more dependent on him because he even wants to infiltrate every detail of the child’s life so that there is no way for the child to leave his care.

It was the evil factor within him.

Xiao Chen changed his sitting position, leaned his head back on the couch, and whined, “You tell me about “The Little Prince” again, I want to hear the part about the rose and the snake.” 

The man laughed, sighed, and said, “The little rose is very beautiful. It is the only rose in the asteroid b612. The snake came to this asteroid by accident, and then it fell deeply in love with the rose. The rose and the snake fell in love, and the snake tried to take the rose away, but the roots of the rose were rooted in the soil…”

–


I’m hungry… 

So hungry…

Wang Xing got up from the bed. She touched her stomach, casually grabbed the mineral water on the bedside table, gulped it down, then hurried to the kitchen in search of food to eat.

She was so hungry that she didn’t even turn on the lights. She drifted as she walked, her stomach was cramping, and her hunger was accompanied by nausea and the desire to vomit.

She pulled out the snacks from the fridge, sat right down, and started stuffing food into her mouth. She only chewed two bites before she hurriedly tried to swallow it. Like a bottomless pit, one bite, followed by the next bite, with bloodshot eyes. 

Her stomach was bloated, but somehow she didn’t feel full at all. She was still hungry.

Liang Jing heard the noise and came out of the room. He saw a squatting figure on the floor from a distance, eating something in the darkened room. He choked, turned on the light, and was instantly horrified and sickened at the sight before him.

Wang Xing was sitting on the floor, holding onto the raw beef in the refrigerator with both hands. She didn’t know if the meat was too old, but she took several bites. There was still blood on the beef, she bit down, and the blood splashed all over, not just in her face, but her hands and clothes were also covered in red.

She seemed to be oblivious, that even when someone came, she didn’t have the slightest desire to spare half a glance to look over. She was immersed in her own world and ate vigorously.

What was even more disgusting was that she seemed to have choked while she ran out of water. So, she directly picked up the plate where the raw beef was initially placed and started to drink the blood inside.

The foul smell of the whole room was getting heavier and heavier…

Liang Jing’s stomach churned. He hadn’t eaten meat for over half a month, and since he buried the corpse, the sight of raw meat was like seeing the corpse that he had decomposed with his own hands, making him nauseous.

When he saw Wang Xing like this, it was as if he was seeing her eating human flesh! 

At the thought, he snapped back and threw up, adding another sour smell mixed with the foul smell of the room.

The female doctor frowned and nodded slightly after hearing about Wang Xing’s symptoms. She wrote something in her medical book with her eyebrows furrowed and said, “Go get a thyroid test first.”

Wang Xing nodded, her whole face was very haggard, and she felt more than ten years older than her actual age. Her stomach was stretched so big that she felt like she was two months pregnant.

After Wang Xing left, the female doctor told Liang Jing seriously, “You must restrain her diet; at this trend, her stomach will burst! This is strange! In all my years as a doctor, I’ve never encountered such a strange phenomenon. You should hide all the food in the house. Give it to her on time and in the right amount. You can’t let her go so crazy, got it?” 

Liang Jing nodded with a blank expression, his appearance revealing some impatience, and then silently walked out.

“Liang Jing, I want something to eat, I beg you!” Wang Xing helplessly smashed the door with her hands, her entire body on her knees, and had a pleading look in her eyes.

Probably tired of knocking, the door took a long time to make a sound, “Bear with me, you’ll be fed in an hour. You must restrain yourself from eating now.”

Wang Xing’s hand was clasped dead against the door. She was locked in by Liang Jing and couldn’t get out. Liang Jing had cut off even the toilet water inside the room. It wasn’t that he was worried that she would be hungry enough to drink it, but that Wang Xing had already done this before! 

“Bang bang!” Wang Xing kept pounding on the door, using her best effort every time. There were very few things in her room, except for the bed, which was a wardrobe pinned to the wall. Liang Jing moved out even the bedside table that was previously placed in the room.

She didn’t know when she had hidden the kitchen knife, but she began to smash the door forcefully with it. But the thing about it was that it was made of iron, and it wouldn’t help if she did that.

Not sure if she was tired or not, but she finally gave up smashing the door, and even the screaming stopped.

Liang Jing sat on the couch and swiped his phone for advice. He was on edge every day, afraid that someone would find the body he had hidden. 

“Ah!!! Ahhhhh!!!” There was a sudden ‘puffing’ sound in the room, followed by the shrieking cries of Wang Xing, which was stretched out long and sharp.

Liang Jing stood up with a scowl. Cursing badly in his heart, he pulled out the key from his pocket and rushed over, intending to open the door.

As soon as he opened it and saw the picture inside, his legs went limp, and he almost fell to his knees.

The floor of the room was covered in blood. Wang Xing’s entire body was paralyzed on the floor, and the kitchen knife was also casually thrown aside. Horrifyingly, her left hand was cut off with a knife by her… she was so hungry that she grabbed her severed hand with her right hand and started stuffing it into her mouth. She was so hungry that she didn’t even have time to bandage the wound and started gnawing on her own flesh… 

Don’t you know? Whoever abandons Kuman Thong will be punished by it…

–

“Stretch your hands.”

With his head buried under the blanket, Xiao Chen silently stretched out his two hands. 

“Face.”

Xiao Chen rolled over and lifted the blanket in one corner slightly, then revealed his face.

The man took the hot towel and carefully scrubbed Xiao Chen’s features, kissed him on the forehead in passing, and seriously cleaned his hands.

“Get up.” The man pulled Xiao Chen out of the quilt, then grabbed the jeans that had been thrown on the floor and put them on the youth. 

Xiao Chen took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and slowly climbed up from the man’s arms. He put on his slippers and prepared to rinse his mouth.

After rinsing his mouth, Xiao Chen was drowsy, and his complexion was very red.

He took a bite out of the man’s neck before leisurely going to eat.

The man was like an old father at home, taking care of his child. He leaned against the door with his eyes on the child’s food, afraid that his child would be a picky eater. 

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows were suddenly raised, and his smile was full as he looked at the man, “Do you know what day today is?”

“?” The man didn’t make a sound.

Xiao Chen trailed off, “Today is the 2,500th day we’ve known each other, and the 520th day we’ve been together.”

The man gave a “Hmmm”. 

Xiao Chen immediately put down his chopsticks and said, “It’s such an important day; let’s go out together today!”

The man paused and smiled somewhat helplessly, “Okay.”

Before he met the child, his world was grey. He didn’t even feel alive, and he didn’t need to eat, sleep, or rest. He didn’t understand love. He was like a machine, doing what he was supposed to do according to the laws of heaven.

Ever since he met this child, his still life began to flow like an hourglass. He began to think and to understood love. His life became vivid. He began to rebel against the ways of heaven, and his consciousness began to awaken. 

The man’s eyes narrowed.

Or, to put it another way, he’d only suddenly become self-conscious after meeting a child, and before that, he was nothing.

The man walked up to Xiao Chen and half-kneeled down, then removed the scythe-shaped necklace from his own neck and gently placed it around the child. With eyes as devout as those of a believer who had encountered the gods, he smiled and said, “Come, my rose.”


“Liang Jing, I’m not sick! Are you out of your mind? Get me out of here! Take me away!!!” Wang Xing struggled on the bed like a madwoman. Her two legs were bound to the corners of the bed, ropes bound her waist, one arm was tied, and the other was tightly bandaged because of her injuries. 

Wang Xing’s eyes were anguished, her expression incomparably hideous and hateful. She struggled with all her might, but she was firmly immobilized.

Liang Jing stood in front of the bed without saying a word.

“I’m telling you! Do you think no one will know what you’ve done if you send me to a mental institution? You’re crazy! You murderous devil!!!” Wang Xing hissed and struggled. She looked at Liang Jing as if looking at the enemy who had killed her parents and could not wait to rush up and bite a piece of his flesh.

Liang Jing’s originally expressionless face somewhat cracked, but it quickly tightened up, and his gaze grew colder. 

Seeing the patient’s emotions become more intense and even starting to speak nonsense, the two nurses beside her looked at each other. One of them rushed forward to press down on Wang Xing’s shoulders, while the other rushed forward to inject her with a sedative.

Liang Jing’s fists clenched, and his eyes were cold as he watched the crazy woman in front of him slowly calm down and then sleep.

This is good too.

She’s in a mental institution now, so no one will ever know what he’s done. He won’t have to spend all day fretting and having to guard against her betraying him.

How great!

Liang Jing withdrew his gaze. His expression immediately became flattering, and he said to the nurse, “My girlfriend has bulimia and has even self-harmed. Now, her brain has become bad, so please take care of her!”

Both nurses looked at him numbly, not taking it to heart, and didn’t say anything back to him.

What was a mental hospital? There’s a bunch of crazy people here! Care? Are you kidding? These people are every bit as dangerous, and as long as they do as they’re told, they’ll certainly take care of them! 

Liang Jing didn’t care about their indifference and was secretly happy.

Finally got rid of this woman!

“Eh, it’s the first time I’ve ever seen this kind of mental illness, the woman who was just sent here today!” One nurse poked the other nurse in the arm with her elbow.

“Isn’t that right! Overeating, self-mutilation, starving to the point of eating their own flesh, and mythomania.” 

“Heh, it’s really a forest full of all kinds of birds!”

It was late at night, the hospital was quiet, and they were the only two female nurses in charge of the night shift.

Nevertheless, because this hospital was very special, all kinds of sounds could be heard at night.

The sound of patients talking to themselves, the screech of scratching the door with their finger caps, the crack of smashing things… 

It was a rough night here, but they were used to it.

“Puff!” It was like something had been smashed.

“There’s something strange about that sound. Should we go check it out?”

“What’s there to see! It’s the same thing every night! It’s not like this is our first night shift! It’s long past time to get used to it!” 

“That’s right.”

Wang Xing’s entire body was paralyzed on the bed. The chandelier that had been hanging from the ceiling smashed straight into the side of her right hand, which was bound. She only had to hook her hand a little to grab the pieces of the chandelier.

In fact, she did. She stared at the rope, trying to cut her way free with the hand that gripped the shard.

Her cold sweat was coming out, and the position was causing her some effort. But she still cut the rope in an odd position. 

The rope wasn’t that thick, and she finally cut it when she ran out of strength!

She broke free!!!

So hungry…

Her eyes widened, her stomach began to twitch and ache. Not only that, but she was also dizzy and wanted to vomit. 

So hungry! I’m so hungry!

She looked around. The whole room was horribly empty, not to mention food, there wasn’t even any water.

She collapsed on the bed in despair, and her whole body began to convulse.

“Anyone? Hello? Help me!!!” She shouted frantically, her voice echoing in the empty room, but no one answered. 

She didn’t know how long it had been, but her voice was about to be hoarse from shouting. Her stomach convulsed even more, and she was close to passing out from the pain. She opened her eyes in a daze, still holding the pieces of the chandelier in her hand.

And this time, her eyes fell on her lap…

Xiao Chen had always been bold; his hand was directly linked with the man’s hand. Even his clothing was matched with two colors, black and white, which looked closer to the man’s style.

“Xiao Chen?” Liang Jing saw Xiao Chen’s figure from afar and was still in a trance. It seemed that he hadn’t seen Xiao Chen since Yuan Zhong’s accident. 

When Liang Jing clearly saw the man’s figure beside Xiao Chen, his body could not help but become a little stiff.

And as soon as he shouted the word ‘Xiao Chen’, the man glanced at him coldly. There was no emotion, and he couldn’t help but be chilled. This simple glance even somehow made him feel a little guilty.

Xiao Chen heard someone call out to him and turned back. After seeing that it was Liang Jing, his eyes narrowed, he didn’t let go of the man’s hand and led him over.

“Long time no see! Where’s Wang Xing?” 

Liang Jing choked and his heartbeat inexplicably accelerated. He felt a bit weak as soon as he looked into the man’s eyes and was even unable to speak. In the end, he could only fidget and say, “It’s a bit complicated to talk about these things. When we have time someday, the two of us will sit down and have a chat!”

After saying that, Liang Jing immediately waved his hand, intending to flee the scene, even the pace of his footsteps was somewhat frivolous.

Xiao Chen didn’t say anything; his eyes noticed the three numbers printed on Liang Jing’s T-shirt. He couldn’t help but hook the corners of his mouth; he slyly glanced at the man and said, “I guess he’ll die soon.”

The man lowered his head to lock eyes with Xiao Chen, touched the child’s face with his other free hand, and said, “You’re really getting smarter.” 

Xiao Chen smiled, and he immediately noticed that the three numbers on Liang Jing’s T-shirt were 1-8-0.

In English, 1-8-0 is one eight zero. If you read these three in English slowly, it will read “Want die serious”. In the 26 letters of the alphabet, the letter D in the word DIE is fourth; I is ninth; E is fifth. 4+9+5=18, 4×9×5=180, so 180 is the number of death.

After all, any fatal accident would be preceded by a warning from the God of Death.

Xiao Chen took out a white rabbit milk candy from his pocket, then stuffed it into his mouth. As he chewed, he said in a vague voice, “Let’s go to the playground! I haven’t played there since I was a kid.” 

The man looked amused at the side of Xiao Chen’s face.

Children often encountered all sorts of accidents from a young age. These accidents didn’t hurt when they happened to others, but once it came to a child, it was very likely that they would die.

In other words, if a man cursed by death goes bungee jumping, the rope will 100% break! If he goes on a roller coaster, his seat is definitely not safe! Death is bound to happen!

That’s why kids never play with these things, but what kid doesn’t like to go to the playground? 

The God of Death sighed, staring at Xiao Chen’s bulging face. He couldn’t help but get his hands on the soft flesh and squeeze it, “If you want to play, then play!”

Xiao Chen was like a little kid who had been caught, his eyes rolled, “No, it’s not that I want to play, I think you want to play! You certainly haven’t played!”

Without blushing, the man replied, “Hmm, it’s me who wants to play!”




The night was too quiet for even the slightest movement such as the sound of a pin dropped on the floor could be heard. 

Sitting alone on the couch, with the lights on in every room, Liang Jing purposely turned on the TV. He turned the TV channel to the central station and put the volume to five, so it wouldn’t be too loud, nor would it send him into silence to the point of panic.

“Thump, thump, thump.” There was a sudden subtle crashing sound in the kitchen. Liang Jing’s heart stumbled, he immediately covered his head with the blanket, grabbed the remote, and put the volume to maximum.

It’s okay. It’s okay.

Don’t overthink it. 

He took a deep breath, and his chest moved.

“Pop!” The TV’s screen shifted, it suddenly began to twitch into streaks of color, and the picture began to reassemble.

Liang Jing’s mouth was slightly open, his two hands clutching the corner of the blanket in a death grip, his eyes full of horror.

The TV turned out to show a car suddenly accelerating and knocking over a girl. The driver seemed confused and then opened the window to look back at the girl’s body. Perhaps it was because he was too nervous, but instead of putting the car into first gear, he threw it into reverse. So the vehicle once again crushed the girl’s body and made a loud scuffling sound.

Only then did the driver re-started the vehicle as if waking up from a dream, speeding away from the scene.

Liang Jing’s hands began to twitch and shake uncontrollably, and his throat was just like a switch that had been pressed to close the sound, so he couldn’t even scream.

He saw it!

This driver was himself!!! 

But the scene didn’t just stop there. After the car sped away, it was as if the picture was static, with no sound and no change.

At this moment, the body of the girl who had fallen in a pool of blood suddenly jerked. The body moved as if it was uncoordinated and then slowly got up in an extremely twisted position, moving very, very slowly. If this scene had happened in a movie theater, Liang Jing might have even laughed at the movement.

But at this moment, Liang Jing couldn’t laugh. It was as if his entire body was set in place, and he began to twitch all over, unable to struggle or even escape.

The girl finally stood still, her hair spread out on her sides. She didn’t open her eyes; both of them were closed. She also had several bloodstains on her face, and those started to flow from her forehead directly to her neck, which looked like it had been broken. With her head hung helplessly on her shoulders, she slowly walked towards the direction of the camera. 

Liang Jing’s heartbeat began to accelerate, so fast that he could even hear the sound of his own “bang bang bang”. He panted for air and wanted to scream, but he could not.

The girl slowly walked forward, and her figure zoomed in a little. She was wearing a blue to white-colored dress with blood all over it. It seemed as if she couldn’t feel any physical pain because even though one of her legs had been bent in two, she still walked forward in a strange and stubborn position.

The girl was getting closer…

She’s about to break through the screen! 

Not only that, but all the lights in the room went dark in an instant. He looked towards the kitchen refrigerator. He could vaguely see a figure sitting there with something in its hand that looked like it was being stuffed into its mouth.

Before he could get a real good look at the person, he suddenly felt something drop onto his face, and the scene in the room began to change, turning out to be the scene of him dismembering the old man with his own hands…

Liang Jing’s heart was beating faster and faster, and his chest began to throb as if he was suffering from a heart attack. He was palpitating and gasping for breath. Suddenly, his eyes rolled back, he froze like a stake and then collapsed completely.

The lights in the room regained their brightness. Even the television changed back to the central channel, emitting the sound of a wordy broadcast. 

Everything, everything had gone up perfectly normal.

You thought you could escape death, but you forgot! Nobody! No one can cheat death!

“This is a strange case!” The female officer had gloves on her hands, and her fingers were constantly flipping through the scene of Liang Jing’s death.

This female officer looked to be in her early forties. 

“The autopsy showed that he died of a sudden myocardial infarction, but oddly enough, his medical records showed that he had never had a cardiac condition of any kind.” She frowned a little as she checked the entire house and indeed didn’t find any medications related to mental illness.

A group of officers nearby looked at each other.

Finally, an intern officer who had been silent for a long time spoke up, “Captain, I just read the documents sent over. Is he also a survivor of the 74666 case?”

“Huh?” The female officer’s mouth was slightly open, and her face was grave, as she hurriedly pulled out a document from her pocket, which was another case she was in charge of. 

It was at this instant that all the police officers looked at each other with serious expressions.

It was very strange!

The female officer narrowed her eyes.

She had received a report just yesterday that another female survivor of the 74666 case had gnawed herself to death from hunger and ended up bleeding to death. 

She had even adjusted the hospital’s surveillance at the time. Even though she was exceptionally psychologically strong, professionally trained, and had even been in the industry for years, she couldn’t help but feel nauseous when seeing images like that.

On discovering that she was a survivor of the same accident as several others, who had all died. She immediately arranged for someone to find the remaining survivors!

Unexpectedly, there’s another one dead!

Is it a coincidence? 

The officer continued, “According to the investigation, the five people who have died so far were all members of the same club. In fact, that club has one other member besides the five of them.”

The female officer cast her eyes over the intern officer, “You, keep talking.”

“As a club activity, they all were supposed to go on a hike and rode a vehicle with the license plate number 74666, but for some unknown reason, they got off the bus altogether. There was actually one person from this club who didn’t participate in this activity that day.” The trainee officer looked at the information, “This person’s name is Xiao Chen.”

“Ding.” Her phone rang, interrupting her thoughts. 

“Hello?”

“Captain! A dismembered old man’s body was found in the area outside of town. It looks like he’s been dead for at least half a month, forensic support requested here.”

“Roger!” The female officer resumed her iceberg face, then said to the intern officer behind her, “You go investigate this Xiao Chen.”

Xiao Chen put both of his calves on the man’s thighs. 

The man pulled the child’s leg, rolled his trousers up, and then began to intimately massage the flesh of the child’s calf, which was so thin that it looked almost fleshless but was soft when squeezed.

Xiao Chen’s mouth was stuffed with a lollipop, and he was bored with his phone playing a small game.

Suddenly, he put down his phone and stared at the side of the man’s face.

The man’s face was white, a somewhat sickly whiteness, but the features were beautiful. Whether it was the hawkish nose or the thin lips, they were fatally attractive to him. 

Xiao Chen’s eyelids fluttered, directly hooking both arms around the man’s neck, the whole person lay in the man’s arms as if he was in a princess hold.

“I fell down! I need a kiss from my husband to get up!” Xiao Chen rolled his eyes.

The man lowered his head to meet the child’s eyes. The child’s eyes were like pools of water, bright and clear. A pair of phoenix eyes were slightly curved into a crescent shape, looking somewhat cute.

He patted the child’s thigh with some amusement and bowed his head, dropping a soft kiss on his eyes as the child looked expectantly at him. 

He liked that look, liked that the youth’s eyes were all about him.

“Stop it, sit still, and I’ll rub your leg!”

Xiao Chen let go of the man’s neck and continued to lie flat, letting out a “hehehe” laugh.

The man’s hand rubbing the child’s leg made a sudden stop as if he sensed something and narrowed his eyes. 

The corners of his mouth rose unexpectedly.

Do you think you can fight Death?

No one would ever know the truth about what Death was trying to hide.

The man’s expression returned to normal, and he continued to massage the child’s leg gently. 

No one can touch the person that Death is trying to protect.

–


“It’s fine. You should also pay attention to your safety during this time.” The male officer put the record book away and prepared to leave. He then turned around and said this to Xiao Chen with a complicated look. 

This case was too strange.

Everyone died by accident! There was no possibility of murder!

How in the world could such a coincidence happen?

Xiao Chen sat on the sofa, his face as usual, and nodded. During the police’s questioning, he aptly revealed three parts of surprise and two parts of sadness when he heard that his companions had died one by one. 

As an officer who had studied psychology, he really didn’t see the slightest flaw in Xiao Chen either.

After the officer left, the originally transparent air became solidified, and then a figure appeared out of thin air.

The man glanced in the direction the officer had left and sat down next to Xiao Chen.

As soon as the male officer left Xiao Chen’s house, he saw the 99+ message on WeChat, and his eyes twitched.

Once it was opened, there were several pictures.

There were photos of Liang Jing and Wang Xing running over a strange woman in their car. There were also photos of Liang Jing killing an elderly man and pictures of them burying a body together.

Captain: Get me a professional team to verify the authenticity of these photos! It was anonymously sent to my phone this afternoon! Figure out an ID for me.

The male officer shoved his phone back into his pocket, looked back at the house of Xiao Chen. He had no idea what to think, shook his head, and left. 

If the pictures were real, several of the recent cases could be over.

“Have you figured out where you want to go this summer?”

Xiao Chen tilted his head, his eyes moved, and resumed the usual side that would only be exclusive in front of a man. Then, he leaned in front of the man and stared at him with big eyes, “When will you marry me?”

One second… 

Two seconds;

“Pfft,” the man laughed without tension in his expression.

Xiao Chen cupped the man’s chin with both hands and said unhappily, “What are you laughing at?”

The man said, “Then, go to Ireland.” 

Xiao Chen frowned and said with dissatisfaction, “Quickly, answer my question.”

The man hugged Xiao Chen’s adjusted posture in his arms, “Didn’t I already give you the bride-price?”. The man’s eyes locked with Xiao Chen’s, and he smiled, concealing his ecstasy well.

This is his light…

Xiao Chen reacted. He reached in through the top collar of his shirt and pulled out the necklace. His eyes were clear, and the ends were slightly upturned, “Is this it?” 

The man didn’t say a word, placed his hand on the child’s shoulder, and then, as the child froze, he kissed him on the bridge of the nose.

He didn’t need to know that what he held in his hand was the life of Death.

It was damaging in every way, but it was the only way for him to counteract the Heavenly Dao. It was also the only way to protect this child from being harmed by the Heavenly Dao.

Xiao Chen shyly touched his nose, then held his chin with his right hand and stared at the man’s face with an idiotic expression, “I’m so happy!” 

Ireland, a country that doesn’t divorce, has a hundred-year agreement.

And he wanted not a hundred years, not a lifetime, but forever.

The man cradled the child in his arms and gazed at the sky outside the window.

This is not the beginning, nor is it the end. 

He has touched the bottom line of the Heavenly Dao and has learned that this does not represent reality.

He withdrew his gaze. The child’s entire body was lying on top of him, and almost immediately, he saw the tattoo on the child’s shoulder blade. When his gaze touched this, his eyes softened.

That’s okay. Just because there are things he can’t remember doesn’t mean he doesn’t know.

However, come what may. 

He could afford to wait!

“Are you accompanied by someone, or are you alone?” The blonde-haired beauty sat next to Xiao Chen and tried to strike up a conversation.

Xiao Chen wore a long-sleeved shirt and a cap that only exposed his chin. He sat alone in the corner of the cafe and looked out the window in silence.

Probably because of his unique Chinese face and temperament, several girls kept casting their eyes at him and whispering softly. 

Finally, there was a girl who was encouraged by her sisters next to her to come forward and ask questions.

Xiao Chen raised his head, and a pair of clean phoenix eyes met the girl’s gaze; the latter was somewhat astonished.

“I’m waiting for my lover.” Xiao Chen didn’t change his face and blurted out after the girl’s question, his tone somewhat cold.

The girl looked surprised, her mouth slightly opened, and then she nodded apologetically. 

Ireland is a country that means loyalty in terms of affection. These ladies are very serious about their relationships. With respect to learning that the strange boy already has a partner, they are sure not to bother and will only have a few regrets.

“Ding-ding.” The door of the cafe opened once again.

A man wearing a black suit walked in. This man looked like he was mixed race. He also was above 1.9 meters tall and had an extraordinary pair of grey eyes.

“Wow, this man is the most handsome I’ve ever seen!” One of the girls couldn’t help but exclaim. 

The man looked in the direction of Xiao Chen, holding a snack bag in his hand. When his eyes touched Xiao Chen, he couldn’t contain a few smiles, and then walked over quickly.

Xiao Chen raised his head. When he saw the man’s figure, a face that had been cold instantly cracked, even the corners of his mouth couldn’t stop rising.

“How come you’ve been gone for so long!” Xiao Chen couldn’t help but have a few complaints.

The man placed the snack bag in front of the child, which was filled with many different flavors of candy. 

The child didn’t like bitter things and had a slight preference for sweets.

The girls who had been paying attention to the two of them for a long time looked at each other.

One girl couldn’t help but say, “They look great together.”

Both men have only each other in their eyes. It’s that sort of look that is revealing and direct, and there’s no attempt to hide it. It’s lovely how sparks can collide just by looking into each other’s eyes. 

Xiao Chen, while eating sweets and complaining about how bored he was just sitting here by himself, couldn’t help but look at the man’s face and smile, “You’re so handsome.”

The man had both his hands on the table, his eyes firmly on the child’s every move, and said with a smile, “No matter how handsome, you’re still the only one.”

Xiao Chen pursed his lips, “How come you’ve been getting so talkative lately, huh?”

“If you want to hear it, then I’ll tell you more later.” The man’s face did not change, and his lips held a smile. 

Xiao Chen quickly finished the sweets, stood up happily, and took the man’s hand without any hesitation, “Let’s go, Mr. Death.”

He winked, “Let’s go on a date!”

“Hmm.” The man gripped the child’s hand tightly.

For the rest of your life, please give me more!

Arc 2 - Cannibal Town

“Is he back?” 

“Not yet.”

“Is he back yet?”

“Hmm, he’s back.”

The mountain road was a bit bumpy. There were many rocks and large potholes mixed with mud and water on the road, which made it a bit difficult to ride with a simple tricycle. 

Xiao Chen wore a turtleneck sweater with a collar covering his nose and mouth, matched with a close-fitting khaki jacket. He sat on the tricycle and simply carried a knee-high suitcase in his hand.

“Young man, look at how bad the road is, you say the price…” The man on the bike spoke, and his eyes that were initially glued to the front couldn’t help but look back a few times.

Xiao Chen raised his head, “You just drive in front. The price is negotiable.” His tone was cold and clear, and his temperament was a bit sullen.

The man got the approval and stopped talking, but was still muttering in his heart.

In such a deserted countryside, the mountain road was so difficult to travel. How come people came for days on end, and all of them were going to that almost abandoned town.

Alas, forget it, what does it matter to him? He just cares about getting money.

Xiao Chen looked at the scenery along the way with an icy expression. If you looked closely, you could see some disgust in his eyes.

If he could, he would rather not return for the rest of his life! 

Xiao Chen’s hand could not help but squeeze into a fist. The back of his nearly sickly white hand shows his veins popping out.

He would never forget the ugly mouths of those in this town and the way these demons were raving.

Xiao Chen clenched his teeth and closed his eyes.

It was probably too windy, plus Xiao Chen was a bit weak, so when the wind blew, he coughed, and his whole body was in a fragile state. 

“Young man, do you have a cold? Put on more clothes!” The man on the bike couldn’t help but speak when he heard Xiao Chen’s cough.

“Mm.” Xiao Chen responded politely, but he was still somewhat absent-minded.

It was already late autumn, and the weather was cool. Xiao Chen wasn’t wearing very little, but at a glance, he was really too thin.

As the tricycle drove into the entrance of the town, it was slowly enveloped by a layer of white fog that came out of nowhere. Xiao Chen frowned at the sight of it. 

“Young man, it’s fine. I’ve been here a few times, and the fog will be gone when we go in a bit more.” The man patiently explained to Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen remained silent.

The wind blew gently, ruffling the nearly yellowed leaves.

He’s back… 

I saw him…

His baby is back…

The town has somewhat deteriorated. It was more of a deserted living tomb with hardly any people, just these mud buildings of unknown age.

There weren’t even the most common roadside daisies, and there were hardly any other plants except for the dying trees. 

At a glance at the fields, all of them were overgrown with weeds and didn’t have much vitality.

If it weren’t for the few older people sitting blankly at the entrances basking in the sun, it would really not seem like a place where anyone lived.

But strangely enough, all the way over, besides the old people, there was not a single strong man, let alone children, to be seen here.

From the moment the tricycle rode into this town, a strange atmosphere was faintly revealed. 

Xiao Chen’s body began to sweat and tremble as he looked at the scenery in front of him.

It was as if he was once again hearing the cries of children, the sound of knives being sharpened, and the sound of pots and bowls colliding.

Xiao Chen felt his stomach turning over, but there was nothing in his stomach, so he could only barely spit out the acid.

Xiao Chen covered his chest, feeling a little bit frightened. He had mild anorexia. He was always nauseous and wanted to vomit, and even his chest felt tight. 

“Boy, here we are!” The man parked the car and helped Xiao Chen take down his suitcase.

Xiao Chen nodded and pulled out twice the originally agreed-upon price from his pocket. The man smiled at the sight of it. While stuffing the money into his pocket, he politely took out his phone number and said, “Alright, alright, if you need to go downhill, contact me anytime, haha.”

Xiao Chen gave a soft “hmm”, his tone was still lukewarm.

He took out a letter from his pocket. He confirmed the address written in the letter before slowly looking up at the dilapidated house. 

The door was old and had many knife marks on it.

Xiao Chen took out his gloves from his pocket and put them on without making a sound before pushing the door open. The door made a creaking sound, which made all the people inside look at him in unison.

Xiao Chen squinted his eyes and looked around.

The people sitting inside didn’t look too far off from his age. There were both men and women, and with himself, there was a total of seven people. 

“It looks like you’re all here!” An older man, who looked to be in his eighties, was holding on to his crutches as he walked down the stairs. His voice was a bit hoarse, as unpleasant as if he had been burned by fire, making everyone in the room shudder at the sound of it.

Inside, a woman who was wearing heavy makeup and revealing clothes, and whose age must have been around thirty, cocked her head and said with an impatient expression, “Can’t you just say what’s wrong? Why did you call us back? Do you think plane tickets don’t cost money?”

The old man’s face did not change, and he did not feel sad because of the woman’s attitude. The look in the man’s eyes actually revealed a bit of affection, “You are Zhang Daniu’s daughter, I didn’t expect that you are already so old!”

But his voice was too awful to hear the goodwill in his tone. 

Xiao Chen stood alone in the corner with his suitcase in silence, not even willing to put down the luggage in his hands. There was still a bit of disgust in his face as if just touching anything in the house slightly could make him sick to his stomach.

The old man sat down and sighed, “You should have seen the current situation in the village.”

Everyone was silent, but there was a strange tacit agreement.

The old man continued with a bit of self-deprecation, “Our village has become a village of old people, without a single strong man or child.” 

Having said that, the old man was agitated for a few moments, and even his body began to tremble. He spoke with some effort and felt like he could pass out in the next second. Xiao Chen watched the scene with cold eyes.

“The seven of you are the only young people left in our village!” The old man lowered his eyes with a bit of grief.

Xiao Chen sneered inwardly.

Retribution. 

Hearing the old man’s disgusting speech, he felt no inner turmoil, only disgust.

People have done it! Heaven is watching! Retribution is not impossible, but the time has not yet come.

The old man still wanted to say something; his gaze swept a glance at everyone present. When his eyes touched Xiao Chen’s figure, the words he originally wanted to say directly came to a halt. His face became somewhat fierce, and his eyes revealed some disbelief. Then, he sat up violently from his seat, and his fingers trembled as he pointed at Xiao Chen, “You, you are that child? ”

The moment the old man pointed at Xiao Chen, everyone’s eyes unconsciously cast towards him. Xiao Chen stood there with a blank expression, his collar blocking half of his face and his eyes cold. Standing in this dilapidated house, his entire person seemed out of touch with the world. 

The old man wanted to examine his face, but before he could get close to Xiao Chen, his pupils shrank dramatically, and his body shook violently. His legs weakened, and he fell to his knees as if he had seen some horrifying scene. His mouth opened wide, but before he could scream, his eyes crossed, and blood flowed out of his eyeballs, then his nose, mouth, ears… The seven orifices were bleeding.

He fell straight to the ground in front of the horrified eyes of the crowd, bleeding to death!

“Aaaaahhhhh!!!”

“Ahhhhh!!!” 

The people began to cover their ears and scream. They got up from their chairs and rushed out towards the front door like madmen.

At once, the whole house was a scene of chaos.

Someone got their feet stepped on by the people around them, and someone else fell to the ground because they were in too much of a hurry…

But Xiao Chen stood there motionless. Before his eyes widened due to the sudden death of the old man, he felt something directly climb up his shoulder, rubbing the position of his shoulder blade repeatedly like it was teasing him. It even poked his collar intentionally or unintentionally, as if it wanted to leap directly into the collar and touch his skin. Still, more than that, it was trying to please him. 

This touch was a bit cold, especially in the late autumn, causing Xiao Chen to shiver.

Xiao Chen cast his gaze to the ground. Through the shadows that hit the ground, he could vaguely see a figure standing behind him. This shadow did not resemble a person, and there were no limbs but only a mass.

Xiao Chen directly covered his chest with his hand, his heartbeat began to accelerate wildly, his lips that were trembling was a little pale, his voice was lost, and his brain seemed to flash.

Before Xiao Chen could think about it, his brain throbbed, his entire body became weightless, and he fell to the side, directly passing out. 

Ah!

You’re finally back! I’ve been waiting for you!

It’s been too long! It’s been too long! What took you so long!

Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for you? 

But it’s okay!

You’re finally back!

–


Xiao Chen opened his eyes in a daze, and his body was a little weak. 

“You’re awake?” The girl cried out in surprise. She stood up from the chair next to her, her eyes revealing some joy.

Xiao Chen silently glanced at her and slowly crawled out of the blanket. He took his hand out of the blanket in disgust and couldn’t help but frown.

This room was shabby, the quilt was stitched together, and even the tool used for lighting the room was just a flickering candle.

The girl didn’t notice his small movements and bashfully lowered her head, saying, “That, my name is Jin Hong.” She glanced up at Xiao Chen and then hurriedly lowered it again, “Originally, we were planning to go down the mountain since it was getting dark, but there was the fog again, and we didn’t know the way, so we came back! When we got back, we saw you lying there.” 

The girl seemed to recall some horrible images. Her face was a little pale, her voice was very small, and she looked a little timid throughout, “Then there are too few rooms, so I can only wrong you to be in a room with me.”

Xiao Chen still didn’t speak.

“Ah!” The girl suddenly felt something fall onto her neck. She touched it and felt something numb to the touch. Her eyes widened, and she screamed out in shock.

It was a spider.

The spider was huge, almost the size of a girl’s palm, and the moment the girl touched the spider, it was like the spider had a spirit, climbing right up her hand and not falling off no matter how much she shook it off.

“Oooooh!” The girl desperately cried out, and her whole body froze in place like a fool.

Xiao Chen squinted and climbed up from the bed, intending to help, but before he could do anything, the spider nimbly jumped off the girl’s hand, then slipped into a crack in some nook and disappeared.

The girl was frightened and couldn’t stop her tears. She could only nod her head vigorously and repeatedly said, “Thank you, thank you.” 

Xiao Chen ignored her. His eyes instead stared thoughtfully at the direction the spider left.

“Are you afraid of spiders?”

“Not afraid.”

“What about one this big?” The boy made a super-sized shape with his hand on his chest. 

The boy, who was even smaller than him, blinked and said, “Not afraid.”

The boy was a little discouraged, “Then what are you afraid of? How can I protect you if you’re not afraid of anything!”

The little boy laughed and put both arms around the other, “Because you’re here, I’m not afraid of anything! I know that you will protect me!”

Xiao Chen snapped out of his memories and silently walked straight to the window, looking at the scenery outside. 

This window looked dirty, piled with a thick layer of dust. There’s no telling how long it had been since it was last cleaned.

It was dark outside the window. Without a streetlight, it was impossible to make out anything but a few rural house buildings.

Xiao Chen’s left hand couldn’t help but touch the necklace hanging around his neck. It was long with a sickle pendant, but the pendant wasn’t made of gold, silver, or stone; it was off-white and not plastic. This pendant was almost close to his heart. He didn’t take the necklace out of his collar but gently touched the shape of the pendant through his clothes.

Tan Jun… 

Xiao Chen closed his eyes and mouthed the words in his heart.

‘I’m here.’

Xiao Chen opened his eyes abruptly and looked around in disbelief.

Apart from him, the only other person in the entire room was that Jin Hong, who hadn’t recovered from what had just happened. 

Did he hear something just now?

The wind from outside was scraping the window, and the sound of the wind rustling could be faintly heard.

Xiao Chen endured the horror in his heart and slowly evened out his breathing, which had suddenly become a little faster.

He didn’t know what he was thinking and attached his hand to the glass of the window. As as soon as his hand was attached, the initially unbearably dirty glass became as clean as new at a pitiful speed, as if it was afraid that he would get his hands dirty. 

Xiao Chen couldn’t help but curl his hand into a fist. He swallowed in disbelief and looked back at Jin Hong, who hadn’t noticed what he was doing.

His hand touched the dusty seat next to him again, intending to sit on it as if to verify something. This time, again, before he could do anything, the dirty chair became clean as well!

Xiao Chen pursed his lips, and a bold idea had been unable to restrain itself from forming in his brain.

As if he had thought of something, his hand once again touched the necklace hanging from his chest and asked, ‘Tan Jun?’ 

Silence.

No one answered.

Xiao Chen’s originally joyful expression instantly went cold, and he felt somewhat ridiculous.

‘I’m here.’ Clear and plain. 

This voice was somewhat hoarse, no longer a slightly childish baritone in his memory, but a voice that only a matured man would have.

It was strange and familiar.

Xiao Chen’s eyes were a little moist and swollen with pain.

‘Tan Jun.’ 

‘I’m here.’

‘Tan Jun.’

‘I’m here.’

Xiao Chen shouted these two words tirelessly, like two children playing a conversation game. 

‘You’ve lost weight.’

The tears that Xiao Chen initially forced himself to withdraw once again came out of his eyes when he heard this. He hurriedly wiped away his tears and pretended to look at the scenery from the window to hide the turbulence inside his heart.

Xiao Chen struggled to control his emotions.

‘I’m sorry.’ Xiao Chen held his eyes strong and didn’t close them, afraid that the tears would just flow down. 

This time, it was like Xiao Chen felt something hug his waist and something like a head rubbed against his neck.

‘Don’t say you’re sorry,’ Xiao Chen felt his neck tingling, something was stroking there, and he heard the man’s say, ‘I volunteered for all this!’

‘I told you I’d protect you!’

‘No matter how many more times! I’ll always protect you!’ It always has been, it always is, and it always will be! 

Good thing you’re back. I would have gone crazy if you hadn’t come back!

No, it’s not right! I’ve already lost my mind!

—

“Tsk tsk,” the boy trailed off, his eyes landing on Xiao Chen and Jin Hong with some mischief in his eyes, teasingly poking fun at them, “Did you get a good night’s rest? Hahaha.” 

“You,” Jin Hong’s face was flushed red with anger, unable to even say a complete rebuttal.

Xiao Chen was still wearing a turtleneck sweater, but it had been changed to a dark green color, covering his mouth and nose as usual.

“Hmph,” the boy sneered, “Who knows what intentions you have, and even helped someone into your room to spend a night together. It’s hard for people to not think about it more, right?”

Jin Hong seemed to have been pierced by some small thought and stomped her foot a bit, “Don’t you dare spill blood!” 

Before the boy could continue to say anything sarcastically, the man next to him, who looked much older than everyone else, stopped and shook his head at him, “Don’t say anything. The priority is to get out of here as soon as possible.”

The people around him looked at each other and nodded. Surprisingly, there was a tacit agreement on the matter, with a bit of fear in their eyes, as if they had encountered some trouble after he fainted last night.

Also, Xiao Chen quickly noticed that the old man’s body in the living room had disappeared, and even the residual blood on the floor had been disposed of cleanly. However, everyone here did not look shocked, and likewise, Xiao Chen also observed that everyone’s nerves were tense. Their eyes were somewhat stiff as they looked around as if they were afraid.

Xiao Chen touched the necklace and felt more than clear. 

Tan Jun.

It was clear outside, but there was no sun in the sky, and it was dreary, even revealing a bit of gloom.

“Um,” the boy who had just made things difficult for Jin Hong began to break out in cold sweat on his forehead. His eyes were a little weak, and his hands were clenched into fists, “Have you noticed that our cell phones have no signal?”

The others were startled. They pulled out their phones and looked at each other, reading a bit of fear in each other’s eyes. 

It was still the big brother, the man with a cold face, who directly took his phone back into his pocket, looked at the faces of everyone, and said sternly, “It seems we don’t have a way to contact the people outside to pick us up. How about this, we people move separately, look for any transportation in the village, and gather back here at noon!”

The man looked at Xiao Chen, “You’ll be in a group with Jin Hong, and I’ll be in a group with Ma Hang.” The man pointed at the boy who had just made a sound, “The remaining three will team up!”

No one refuted.

Xiao Chen squinted his eyes, scrutinizing the man’s face carefully, then swept a glance at the boy called Ma Hang. 

As if confirming something, he then glanced at his head and hooked his lips.

Heh, so it’s you guys.

–

“Hey,” the boy stopped Xiao Chen, his gaze fierce. Behind him stood someone even smaller than Little Xiao Chen, crouching fearfully behind the stake, showing only two eyes. 

“Give me what you’ve got to eat!” The boy made a threatening noise and appeared to be ready to just grab it if Xiao Chen didn’t give it.

He’s been hungry for too long! How could he not be excited when he saw that Xiao Chen had food in his hand.

Little Xiao Chen was so much shorter than the boy that he took a somewhat fearful step back. He hugged the dead fish he had just picked up from the river that was no more than half the size of his hand tightly in his arms and tried his best to say out loud, “No.”

The boy curled his mouth and planned to go straight for it, but a rock flew from nowhere and directly hit the boy’s head. 

Tan Jun rushed out and directly protected Xiao Chen in his arms, like a lone wolf protecting a cub. His eyes were dark, and his tone was cold, glaring at the boy, “You dare to try to touch him!”

The only thing that keeps me alive as a walking corpse is my belief that you’ll be back!

As soon as you get back! I’ll never let you have a chance to leave me!

– 


“Where are we going?” Jin Hong looked anxious, her entire body leaning very close to Xiao Chen, but there was a certain distance between them. 

Xiao Chen was sensitive to his own safe area, but he was unable to avoid the girl’s approach despite that.

“Go to the alleyway.” Xiao Chen’s tone was somewhat cold.

Jin Hong nodded a little timidly, her eyes wandering.

It was strange. 

Xiao Chen noticed that when they were walking on these roads, those old men who were like walking corpses yesterday stood up in unison with their eyes fixed intently on them.

Obviously, they were all old people who were almost in their twilight years. Still, their arms and legs were very flexible, not in harmony with their thin bodies.

Jin Hong was a little scared of the stares and hid behind Xiao Chen’s back.

Xiao Chen’s face was sharp, and from a great distance, he saw an old man at the door using a huge pot and withered tree branches picked up from the mountain. He was boiling water, holding a kitchen knife in his hand, squatting on the ground, and repeatedly rubbing the blade on the grindstone, looking like he was about to slaughter a pig.

Seeing the figure of Xiao Chen and the others, they directly stood up with their kitchen knives, looking at them expressionlessly, and even meeting Xiao Chen’s eyes without any fear.

Xiao Chen’s eyes were a little dark and chilly, and his hands and feet were trembling slightly out of control.

Once again, his mind was filled with a scene that he could not forget for the rest of his life.

The knife slashed across the person’s neck, blood immediately spurted out and splashed onto the surrounding people’s clothes. Everyone’s expressions were incomparably cold, not even showing the slightest emotion. They were standing to one side with cold eyes, quietly watching the person holding the knife rotate back and forth on the slaughtered person’s neck. 

The slaughtered man was unable to scream at all because his arms and legs were bound and his throat was slit, and even his arms and legs could only twitch slightly.

Xiao Chen’s began to feel nauseous, his two hands clenched into fists, cold sweat emerged from his forehead one by one, and his head began to feel dizzy.

The old man looked at Xiao Chen and had no idea what he saw. His face, which was like a dead fish, cracked, and even the knife fell directly to the ground. He breathed rapidly for two seconds and crawled back to the house without looking back.

Jin Hong had hidden behind Xiao Chen and cried out, “Is he gone?” 

Xiao Chen’s hands were full of cold sweat, and he let out a sigh of relief, “Yes.”

Slowing down, Xiao Chen and Jin Hong forced themselves to pull themselves together and look for any kind of transportation nearby, but it was too strange!

There wasn’t even one of the most common livestock like chickens, ducks, and fish here, not to mention transportation. Every house was very old, even the walls were mud walls, and it was unknown which century they were built in.

“I’ve searched the entire village, and there’s none at all!” Ma Hang was a bit frustrated and couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice, “Damn, this village is too strange, I shouldn’t have come back in the first place!” 

Ma Hang pushed the man next to him, “Brother, what to do!”

The moment Ma Hang pushed the man’s body, he suddenly shuddered. His whole body was like a lost soul and his eyes that were deflated slowly focused when Ma Hang pushed him.

Ma Hang saw that his brother ignored him and only thought that the other party was distracted by his thoughts and was not annoyed.

Ma Chenggong held his forehead, and his body began to shake. 

When he saw who was next to him, he couldn’t help but open his mouth wide, “Ma Hang?”

Ma Hang turned back and responded, “Brother.”

Ma Chenggong looked around.

Rugged mountain road, uninhabited mountain village, mountain forest that was so remote that there wasn’t even a single bird… 

Ma Chenggong couldn’t help but cover his heart. His entire body was like in a different world.

Was he still alive?

Thinking of this, Ma Chenggong’s eyes were cold, and the moment Ma Hang didn’t look at him, Ma Chenggong looked at him with hatred in his eyes.

I was that good to you! You did that to me! 

Ma Chenggong swallowed his saliva and forced himself to calm down. He held his right hand to his forehead to conceal the resentment and the ecstasy of his rebirth.

But soon, he thought of his situation, and his heart went cold again.

He said tentatively, “The others, how are they?”

Ma Hang blinked, hearing his brother ask the question was strange but didn’t think much of it, “Just like that, who knows what happened to them. Wait until the noon assembly to see if they found any transportation to get back.” 

As soon as he heard that, Ma Chenggong was immediately clear on the current timeline.

It was the time before everything had even started!

His teeth clenched, and he began to remember.

The village is called Laodu Village, where he and his brother Ma Hang lived when they were young. When he was young, there was a famine here, and the village even experienced human cannibalism. 

The first people the village people attacked were childless widows married in from other villages, and then the defenseless children.

Have you heard of the motherhood experiment of the Japanese Unit 731?

Confine mothers and young infants to a house where they could be cooked to a crisp and test their reactions.

To see if mothers would protect their children from the heat by cradling them in their arms, or if they would choose to step on their children to protect their feet from being burned. 

At that time, the prevalence of human cannibalism had reached the point where it was easy to eat each other’s children, no less than this horrific motherhood experiment.

Since then, the village has been under a terrible curse!

Infertility, all kinds of bizarre deaths… The village was becoming less populated, and many people even tried to move away from the area. The fatalities didn’t stop with the passage of time and even got weirder…

The seven people who had returned now were the only young people left in the entire village! 

Ma Chenggong’s body shuddered.

But he knew! They will die too!!!

The moment he closed his eyes before he died, he saw a figure behind the crowd!

Just one glance! 

And he recognized the man!

It’s Tan Jun!

That maniac!

This is not man-made at all! It was the ghosts! 

Ma Chenggong sucked in a breath of cold air, not knowing what memories had appeared in his head, and both of his legs began to tremble uncontrollably.

“It’s you guys!” Jin Hong called out when she saw the Ma Hang duo, but she frowned and didn’t take a step forward.

Ma Chenggong’s body perked up at the sight of Xiao Chen and took a step back, his horror completely undisguised.

Xiao Chen was the first one to die out of the seven of them! 

He had been dipped in the frying pan!

Even the skin was burnt and fried, and the whole body was red and swollen, as ugly as a slaughtered pig. The man was thrown in and screamed miserably, and within a few minutes, he was burnt to a pulp.

And there he stood, seeing the scene from start to finish!

Xiao Chen was baffled by the look in Ma Chenggong’s eyes, but he didn’t say anything. He stood far away from them, with absolutely no desire to get closer. He had a physical dislike for these people. 

The wind gently blew over, and the leaves of the dead tree were blown in a circle on the ground.

Xiao Chen suddenly felt something cold and icy holding his hand, and when he looked down, it was just air, or rather, it was just that he couldn’t see it.

But Xiao Chen’s heart was at peace.

In this world, anyone could have hurt him, but he knew that Tan Jun would not. 

“Ah-choo!” Ma Chenggong felt his feet get cold, as though being surrounded by icebergs, making him sneeze.

Tan Jun wouldn’t let anyone off the hook!

Ma Chenggong gritted his teeth, his body trembling terribly.

If he had known this would happen, he shouldn’t have done those things! 

He thought he had escaped far enough to get away from the nightmare! Who would have thought!

The damn village chief sent him a letter!

It was a critical time for his promotion! If those things in the letter were exposed! His future is ruined!

Who would have thought! 

It was all just a trick by Tan Jun to get them back! The goal was to get rid of them all!

Ma Chenggong had a sense of powerless despair.

He simply couldn’t forget about the pain that his body felt when he was on the verge of death. It was like ten thousand insects drilling and biting his body, which hurt more than if he had broken his hand.

The mental torture was only more torturous! 

If he came back once to die again! How could he be happy!

—

My baby’s finally back!

You disgusting people can all go to hell! 



“Damn, there are too many bugs in the mountains!” The woman was wearing high heels, both her legs were a little soft, and she kept complaining along the way, unable to resist cursing out. 

Except for Xiao Chen, who didn’t ask questions, the other five people were a bit impatient with her.

“What kind of shabby village is this! There’s not even a vehicle! There’s still no signal in the mountains! What the hell!” The woman cursed and was dressed in gold and silver, but she couldn’t hide her vulgarity.

She was the woman who had first spoken in front of the old man, the daughter of Zhang Daniu.

“I think the situation is a bit urgent now. We can’t just sit around and wait anymore!” Ma Chenggong quickly steadied himself, rubbing both of his hands against his trouser legs, “There must be no available transportation in the village! There’s no electricity here either, not to mention there’s no signal on our phones. In a little while, they’ll run out of battery and just shut down! When that happens, we’ll really be in a dead-end!” 

Everyone’s complexion was a bit ugly, and even if Ma Chenggong didn’t say anything, everyone had actually guessed this level.

“So, I’ll just say it!” Ma Chenggong raised his head with a hidden agenda, swept these people’s faces, and said, “While it’s still noon, it’s not too late for us to walk straight down the mountain! Otherwise, if we keep delaying, there will be no food here, and as soon as we finish the food we brought, we’ll starve to death sooner or later in this godforsaken place!”

Ma Chenggong tensed the muscles on his face.

Before, they were the ones who had repeatedly procrastinated time and time again. As a result, they had fallen into a situation where they had no food, no electricity, and no clean water. Before Tan Jun came to their door, they had already started killing each other.

Ma Hang was the first to step forward and unconditionally supported his brother, saying, “I agree!”

Ma Chenggong looked at him with complicated eyes. The resentment couldn’t stop coming up and was repeatedly pushed down.

The woman, Zhang Xiaoxian, tossed her long wavy hair, pulled out a card from her wallet, and said, “In that case, I won’t follow you. This is a deposit, there’s a hundred thousand in it, and as long as you go down the mountain and shout for someone to come up and take me down, the payment will be ten times this.”

Everyone looked at each other, seemingly disapproving of her actions. 

Ma Chenggong sneered for a moment, he was a bit angry and dissatisfied, but he did not argue back.

Xiao Chen’s face was pale, and his eyes were downcast. He stood there sullenly, not participating in the crowd’s discussion from beginning to end.

It was only when everything had been decided that he spoke indifferently, “I’m not leaving.”

Everyone was a little surprised, but they were dissatisfied more than that, thinking that he had to do the same with money as Zhang Xiaoxian. 

When Jin Hong heard Xiao Chen say that, she immediately wanted to hold his hand, intending to say something to him.

“You don’t have to bother with me.” Xiao Chen directly dodged Jin Hong’s hand and frowned lightly. His appearance was as calm as ever. Both of his hands were stuffed in his pockets, and he walked out the door without looking back.

Tan Jun is still here! How could he leave! He came back here for Tan Jun!

Xiao Chen touched the pendant on his neck. 

It seemed that someone suddenly let out a soft laugh, this laugh was so weak that it could be ignored by everyone, but this laugh contained a thousand spoils(pampering) as well as helplessness.

Ma Chenggong looked at Xiao Chen’s back and cursed that he was sick.

Forget it! Who cares!

Ma Chenggong continued to play his role as a core leader and said, “Everyone, get ready, we’re going down now!” 

When Xiao Chen walked out of the door, he paused at the entrance. He began to walk purposefully in a particular direction as if he was looking for something.

His hand involuntarily rubbed the pendant around his neck. He had only been walking for a short time, but cold sweat already couldn’t stop coming out of his forehead. His vision was even blurred, and his stomach began to contract, pumping hard and painfully.

But for some reason, he seemed to be stubborn, and even though his legs were starting to weaken a little, he still pushed himself forward.

He rounded several corners and entered a few alleys before he finally stopped in front of a house. 

The house looked like it had been abandoned for ten years, withered and barren as if it had been washed away by heavy rains and had collapsed in half because it couldn’t hold up. Even the tiles on the ground had become fragile due to weathering.

Xiao Chen was so pale that his sickly face looked utterly bloodless.

With both knees directly on the ground, he opened his mouth but did not make a sound, his right hand tightly gripping the pendant.

‘I’m here.’ Tan Jun’s voice came from the bottom of his heart. 

Xiao Chen’s entire body looked weak, there was little flesh on his face, arms, and legs, but when he heard Tan Jun’s voice, there was a throbbing pain in his heart. He asked out, “Are you hurt?”

Tan Jun knew what he was asking.

‘It doesn’t hurt.’

Xiao Chen swallowed his voice to hold back his tears. Not knowing what came to mind, he shuddered a little, “Why can’t you just blame me?” 

The man chuckled softly, ‘Unwilling to let go.’

Tan Jun leaned his head on Xiao Chen’s neck and crouched down on the ground, circling Xiao Chen’s entire body with his hands, as if he was holding him in his arms.

But Xiao Chen couldn’t see him.

Tan Jun’s eyes were dark, with undisguised possessiveness. 

Wait a little longer, and I’ll let you see me again!

Even if my body is destroyed, my soul remains forever. My love for you is like a specimen soaked in formalin, never decaying, but with absolute madness and paranoia, and even death cannot separate you from me.

“Knock knock.” Outside the door was a soft knock.

Zhang Xiaoxian huffed out a breath, tidied her hair again, and was not in a hurry to open the door. 

It was a bit strange how these people left not long ago and then came back again!

Suddenly, she thought of Xiao Chen, who hadn’t left like her and snickered.

It should be him.

“Knock knock!” This sound was harder than the one before it. 

“Coming! Coming! What’s the rush!” Zhang Xiaoxian frowned impatiently, but in her hand, she leisurely took nail polish to paint her nails, her favorite red color.

“Knock knock!” The knocking outside the door did not stop because of Zhang Xiaoxian’s response. The sound was getting louder and louder. It sounded like the person knocking on the door was manic and felt like he could break in the next second.

Zhang Xiaoxian cursed a couple of times, unable to hold back, and rushed out, intending to teach him a lesson.

“There’s something wrong with you!” Zhang Xiaoxian fiercely opened the door, intending to point at the other party’s nose and scold him, but when she got a thorough look at him, her entire body froze in place. 

There was an old man who looked to be in his sixties standing in the doorway. The old man was thin and haggard, with deep wrinkles on his neck. His eyes were somewhat white with sunken eye sockets. His skin was also dark, and the corners of his mouth unintentionally turned upward, revealing a curve.

“Are you hungry, little girl?” The old man’s voice was hoarse, and his eyes were fixed on Zhang Xiaoxian’s leg, even looking up and down at Zhang Xiaoxian’s body, looking sort of friendly.

Of course, the premise was that the old man didn’t have a knife in his hand.

“Ahhhhhhh!!!” Zhang Xiaoxian was pale and ran back like a madman. Her entire pace was chaotic and erratic! 

While running, she even lost one of the slippers from her feet and then ran to her room.

“Help! Help!!!”

The old man laughed, revealing a mouth full of yellow teeth, and didn’t look the least bit disturbed by Zhang Xiaoxian’s reaction.

“How disobedient, and still trying to play peek-a-boo with me! Oh!” 

I’m going to have another good meal today!

–


“Fuck, haven’t we already been down this road before!” Ma Hang was a little anxious. His fingers couldn’t help but clutch at the corners of his coat, and his eyes were constantly scanning the surroundings. 

Similarly, as when they came here, a thin layer of fog surrounded this mountain road’s perimeter. There were only sparse dead trees in this deserted countryside and nothing else. Even the sky was dusky, revealing a spooky atmosphere.

Ma Chenggong tried to conceal his panic and anxiety and forcefully pretended to be calm.

A light breeze blew through, bringing a hair-raising chill to the air.

“I, we’re going to be stuck here!” Jin Hong was the only girl among the five. She was a little stiff and cowered behind the crowd, her legs even more so because of her nervousness. 

Ma Chenggong sweated and swallowed anxiously, his two hands clenched into fists.

“Do you have anything on you that we can use to make a mark, so we can definitely get out?” Ma Chenggong smiled forcefully, and it wasn’t clear if these words were meant to convince others or himself.

Jin Hong’s chest rose and fell a little from sobbing. She pulled out the lipstick she had with her from the bag and said, “I, I have lipstick.”

Ma Chenggong took the lipstick, drew a big symbol on a nearby tree, and turned back with a dry smile, “Let’s go and try again.”

Everyone didn’t argue, and it had become clear to them that this seemingly peaceful town was bizarre in every way.

There was only a bunch of old people here! There was also the old village chief, who had died in front of them for no reason, and whose body had even inexplicably disappeared! There was something unspoken and frightening about the village, and they knew full well that if they didn’t do anything, they might be in danger.

Silence.

There was silence once again. 

An exhausted group of people walked in circles over and over. No one was in the mood to talk, and only the sound of feet on the ground can be heard.

“For the fourth time!” Hu Bing, who had been silent for a long time, opened his mouth.

This was a boy who seemed to be in his early twenties but had an exceptional temperament. He looked very mature, and his back was straight, with a sense of maturity that didn’t belong to this age.

Ma Chenggong’s expression somewhat cracked. He had already tried his best to hide his anxiety. Still, He ended up looking a bit fierce as his face was completely exposed to everyone. 

“Maybe we should go back first.” Hu Bing looked at the sky, scanned the crowd who had long been exhausted from walking, and proposed his idea.

“No!” Ma Chenggong retorted, his eyes widened, and the sound he made was as sharp and piercing.

Even Ma Hang was shocked by his expression and voice and couldn’t help but pull his brother’s arm, “Brother.”

Ma Chenggong was instantly knocked awake by Ma Hang’s voice, his face as ugly as death. He barely managed to regain his appearance, opened his mouth, and said, “In that case, let’s go back first. We’ll discuss everything later!” 

How could they understand his inner anxiety! Turning back is death! Who could know the pain of that approaching death better than him?

But he can’t talk!

Ma Chenggong pursed his lips and took a deep breath.

This was his burden. 

He knows who is cursing this village!

Xiao Chen opened his eyes in a daze, and his body was a little sore.

“You’re finally awake! Why did you faint in the doorway!” As soon as Xiao Chen opened his eyes, he saw Jin Hong with a happy face chattering non-stop. Many people were sitting around the entire room, each of them brushing past the moment Xiao Chen opened his eyes.

When Ma Chenggong saw Xiao Chen wake up, his body scuffled, and he sat up directly from the chair. His mouth opened, he rubbed his hands and stomped his feet, as if he had something urgent to say to Xiao Chen. 

Xiao Chen glanced at everyone with indifferent eyes as if he had fallen into some kind of memory and lowered his gaze, “I don’t know.”

Ma Chenggong was in disbelief and walked to the bed, asking hurriedly, “Then how did you faint? What about Zhang Xiaoxian?”

Xiao Chen scowled and looked serious, “Not sure.”

Ma Chenggong seemed to be a little frantic, and when he heard Xiao Chen’s reply, he looked as if he was planning to ask something. 

But before he could say anything, there was a sudden knock at the front door.

Ma Chenggong was at a loss of what to do as he took a look at the door.

Everyone looked at each other as if they were deciding who would open the door.

Was it Zhang Xiaoxian? 

Hu Bing didn’t have those twists and turns in Ma Chenggong’s heart, and when he saw that everyone was reluctant to open the door, he stood up straight away, intending to open the door.

When Hu Bing opened the door, he was stunned and stood still. The people who followed behind him were also a bit confused.

It was an old man.

The old man held a huge pot in his hand. He was smiling as he walked right in, put the pot on the table in the hall, and said, “Children, you must be hungry since you haven’t had hot food for so long, come and have a bite of unenviable sheep.” 

Others might not understand, but Ma Chenggong had lived in this village for sixteen years before he left, so of course, he knew what the old man meant!

Ma Chenggong was shaking, and his legs began to tremble as images instantly popped up in his head. His body held onto the wall next to him, retching, but only managed to puke out acid.

Xiao Chen didn’t come out and didn’t know about the scene outside. If he was there, he could also understand the meaning of the unenviable sheep in seconds. It was even possible that his reaction would be more intense than Ma Chenggong’s.

The crowd looked at Ma Chenggong with confused faces, not knowing why he was reacting so strongly. 

Ma Hang felt a bit gluttonous when he saw that it was meat. After all, he had been here for a few days, and all he had eaten was dry food that he had brought over. Not to mention meat, there wasn’t even any rice.

Ma Hang swallowed, a little embarrassed.

As if the old man had read his mind, he narrowed his eyes and beckoned, “Son, come and eat.”

Ma Hang pursed his lips. 

This meat looked fat and lean, with a reddish color and a rich aroma floating out.

It smelled so good.

Ma Hang’s expression was a bit obsessed, and he actually planned to walk over, but Ma Chenggong crouched on the ground and pulled him back, shouting hurriedly, “Don’t go!”

Ma Hang was shocked and immediately stopped. He did not know what was going on. He was just like a compelled person, and the only thing in his eyes was the pot of meat. He was completely hooked up to the food in his heart. 

Ma Hang was a little afraid, fearfully took a step back, and whispered, “Brother.”

Jin Hong was also a little hungry. She was already tired and hadn’t eaten anything for half a day. Now, she was visually stimulated by the meat, and her taste buds were becoming more spiteful from the aroma. However, she still had a few moments of sanity left and didn’t act rashly.

When Hu Bing saw this display, he silently retreated to the side, intentionally moving away from this old man.

Hu Bing looked again at Ma Chenggong’s reaction, and something flashed in his head. Then, his eyes stared intently at the meat placed on the table. Recalling what he had seen and heard in the village in the past few days, a ridiculous idea popped into his head. Slowing down, he looked at the old man in horror and opened his mouth to say, “This meat…” 

Ma Chenggong picked up his words, “This is human meat!”

What?

Everyone’s heads exploded, and their eyes stared blankly at Ma Chenggong.

Ma Chenggong trembled and stood up, his eyes staring at the old man, questioning, “There is no livestock in the village at all! Where the hell did you get that pot of meat from? What did you do to Zhang Xiaoxian?” 

The crowd woke up from their dreamlike state.

Ma Hang’s eyes widened. Then, his expression at the meat instantly became disgusted, simply finding it hard to accept that he had been piqued by human flesh.

Jin Hong shrieked and hid behind the crowd.

The old man’s friendly face was torn, both eyes wide, and he grinned as if annoyed by what Ma Chenggong had said, his chest puffing out slightly as he took a deep breath. 

“You guys aren’t even eating such delicious food!” The old man looked incredulous.

“Hmph!” The old man snorted and glared coldly at Ma Chenggong. Then, he walked in the direction of the door without turning back, not answering Ma Chenggong’s question from beginning to end. It really looked as if the old man was as annoyed to see the young man waste food.

Jin Hong had never seen such a scene before and nearly fell to her knees as her legs weakened. But she was held back by Hu Bing, who was standing beside her.

Xiao Chen came out of the room and only saw the back of the old man leaving. Almost immediately, he spotted the cooked meat on the table. As he stared at it, his heart rate started to accelerate, his legs went weak, and he fell to his knees directly on the floor. Both of his hands held onto the wall, and images popped straight into his head. 

“Just this kid! No father, no mother! No one will care if we eat him!”

Xiao Chen had a ringing in his ears, and the voice that haunted him in his dreams for half his life appeared in his head again.

“What are you running for! Damn it! How dare you kick me! I’ll break this kid’s legs! I’m going to skin him alive!”

No! No! No!!! 

Xiao Chen’s breathing quickened, and his eyes began to turn red.

“No!” Xiao Chen suddenly screamed and let out a cry. He was curled up in the corner and held his head.

The crowd was startled by Xiao Chen’s shout and turned back to look at him.

“Don’t go! Tan Jun!” Like a madman, Xiao Chen covered his head, his eyes wild and dispirited. 

The next second he covered his nose and mouth again, shrinking himself in a strange posture, as if afraid of making any sound as if he was scared of being heard by others.

Ma Chenggong was completely shaken in place, his hands shaking a bit when he heard the word ‘Tan Jun’.

His Adam’s apple moved, and his eyes returned to Xiao Chen’s face. He stared at his features and covered his mouth and nose on the verge of almost screaming out.

It’s him! 

It was him!

Tan Jun was a little distressed as he hugged Xiao Chen in his arms, even though he knew that Xiao Chen couldn’t see him at all.

‘Don’t be afraid.’

Xiao Chen grasped the pendant and fiercely raised his head towards the source of the voice. 

But this time, what he saw was no longer just a patch of air but a half-real image. This image even had three-dimensional features, a deep nose, thin and faint lips that were exposed, but the body parts were still illusory.

Xiao Chen’s eyes didn’t even blink, and his eyelashes trembled slightly.

“Tan Jun.” I can see you!

Sorry! 

If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t be dead!

—

You don’t know that I’m the only one with a grudge in this town.

Not because of how deep my grievances run, but because I have voluntarily taken on the grievances of others to hold on to this place. 

The only thing I ever wished for was to be able to wait until you came back.

But now, my desire is to keep you by my side.



“Boy Ma, don’t blame Uncle. Uncle’s wife is pregnant, and this is my only child! If we don’t eat anything, my child will starve to death!” The man’s cheeks were sunken, his eyes were completely black underneath, and his limbs were even thinner. He held an axe in his hand used for chopping wood and stared at Ma Chenggong with undisguised greed. 

The boy knelt on the ground, with a face filled with fear and a trembling body. His two hands kept tensing, “I beg you, Uncle! I have a brother to look after. Have you forgotten how my father died? My father drowned to save your daughter-in-law! I’m begging you! You can’t take back what you’ve been given!”

The man’s originally greedy eyes flashed because of these words. There were a few hesitations, and even the hand holding the axe loosened.

Before the boy was relieved, something came to the man’s mind, and his eyes became ruthless, “I’m sorry to your whole family, I will repay you in the next life as a cow or a dog! Now, I’ve run out of options!”

The boy almost fainted. His frightened eyes moved as if he had an idea. Immediately, he nodded off a few times and hurriedly said, “I, I have another way, there’s someone else but me! Why does it have to be me? For example, the little beggar who lives at the end of the village, Xiao Chen! He could be the one too!” 

When the man heard this, he was a little moved.

Seeing that there was still hope, the boy immediately shouted, “I, I’ll call out Xiao Chen! You let me go! I can help you get Xiao Chen!!!”

Ma Chenggong woke up with a jolt, his eyes wide open, and he gasped for air. He was still drowning in the nightmare he just had.

“Brother, what happened to you?” Ma Hang slept next to him and was awakened by the sudden movement.

Ma Chenggong turned his head and met Ma Hang’s eyes.

Ma Hang was a bit affected by his gaze. His lips trembled, and he asked, “What, what’s wrong?”

Ma Chenggong withdrew his complicated eyes and stared at the ceiling, trying to go to calm his emotions, “Nothing.”

Xiao Chen was staring at Tan Jun’s face without moving. 

His fingers were touching something in the air, his movements were light, and his eyes were full of tenderness, “So this is what you’ll look like when you grow up.”

Tan Jun didn’t say anything and looked at him with complicated eyes. His eyes swept back and forth over his body several times. “Have you not been taking care of yourself?”

Xiao Chen froze and blinked. His eyes dodged a bit, and he laughed lightly, “It’s fine.”

Tan Jun frowned and sternly said, “You haven’t eaten since this afternoon! It’s late at night, and you still haven’t eaten!” The man paused. His jaw was a little tight, and his eyes were closed. He took a deep breath, pushed his temper down, and softly said, “Do as you’re told, and go get something to eat!” 

Tan Jun dropped his eyes.

Hunger was really hard to bear. The stomach was empty, and the hunger was so extreme that it would start to twitch. The body would become weak, and the longing for food would magnify by thousands. To fill this need, one could do a lot of depraved things. Even though he no longer needed to eat, the feeling was deeply imprinted in his memory.

Tan Jun’s eyes narrowed slightly as he thought of this.

Xiao Chen smiled and looked innocent, “I’ll eat, don’t be angry.” 

Tan Jun was coaxed out of his temper and wrapped his arms around Xiao Chen, who couldn’t touch him but could actually feel the other man’s warmth.

“Don’t be afraid. I will find you.”

“Good, good, you believe in me. There will be no one else but you. I will never live in the world if you leave.”

“….” 

“Baby, are you asleep?”

“….”

Tan Jun’s brain throbbed, and images flashed through his head.

He could vaguely see two people. 

A man in a black suit was holding someone with a blank expression, and he could even clearly feel that the man’s hands were trembling a bit.

But strangely enough, he could neither see the man’s face nor the face of the person in his arms.

The other seemed to be asleep, lying quietly in the man’s arms. The blanket covered his legs, and he was so well-behaved that it made Tan Jun feel a little flustered.

The eyes of the man who was holding the person began to change. His eyes that were originally lowered slowly lifted and looked in Tan Jun’s direction. His eyes narrowed as if he was trying to identify something, and then his gaze became sharp. 

It was at this moment that a sentence appeared in Tan Jun’s mind.

‘He must be protected!’

Tan Jun fiercely opened his eyes, his elbows trembling slightly, and released Xiao Chen.

Under Xiao Chen’s astonished gaze, his body became clearer, even condensing into solidity at a pitiful speed. 

Xiao Chen opened his mouth, and his eyes remained on Tan Jun’s body. He tentatively touched the other man’s face, his fingers trembling a little.

Before he could attach his hand, Tan Jun directly grabbed his hand and gently placed it on the left side of his face. His head was slightly tilted, and he looked at him with a smile.

“I was the one who didn’t protect you.”

— 

Jin Hong was in shock and had barely closed her eyes the entire night. She looked a bit haggard.

The atmosphere in the whole room was a bit stuffy.

“By the way, I don’t even know your names?” The boy who had been sitting the whole time silently suddenly made a sound.

The boy was the youngest of the seven and looked to be around sixteen or seventeen years old. He stood over 1.8 meters tall and had a very healthy and sunny look, but he still had that youthful look about him. 

“My name is Huang Ke,” The boy’s eyes were bright, and one could tell that he hadn’t been exposed to much of the darkness of society, “My father used to be from this village, but he passed away this year…” Speaking of this, his eyes darkened for a moment. Still, he quickly adjusted them again and said. “I came back because I received an invitation letter from the village and suddenly wanted to see where my dad used to live.”

Jin Hong looked tired, and her voice was a bit weak, “My name is Jin Hong.”

Hu Bing nodded and signaled, “I’m Hu Bing.”

Ma Hang hadn’t rested too well, and his body was a bit worn out, but he managed to pull out a smile, “I’m Ma Hang, and this is my brother, Ma Chenggong.” He pointed to his brother next to him, “I came back with him.” 

Xiao Chen raised his eyes and made eye contact with Ma Chenggong, who had been stealing glances at him, the latter clearly panicked and looked away.

Xiao Chen quietly stared at Ma Chenggong and indifferently said, “My name is Xiao Chen.”

As soon as Ma Chenggong heard this, he shuddered, and his eyes darted as if he was trying his best to hide his inner panic.

Damn it, before being reborn, Xiao Chen was the first to die. He died without the six of them even knowing his name! 

If he really was Xiao Chen, then it all made sense!

He chose Xiao Chen to save himself! Then, Xiao Chen had killed Tan Jun to stay alive.

No wonder Tan Jun hated him so much! The first target of Tan Jun’s revenge was Xiao Chen!

Wait, then why was it that the first one to die this time was Zhang Xiaoxian and not Xiao Chen? 

Before Ma Chenggong could think about it, Hu Bing, who stood at the side, seemed to have remembered something and gazed towards Ma Chenggong, “You know that woman from yesterday, don’t you? You even knew her name!”

Ma Chenggong blinked. Obviously, Hu Bing was almost ten years younger than him, but at this point, he was a bit weaker in momentum. He nodded his head a bit nervously, “Yes.”

Hu Bing looked around at everyone and said, “All of us are descendants of this village, but I have no memory of this place. My family and I left this village sixteen years ago when there was a famine in this village!”

He paused, keeping his eyes firmly on Ma Chenggong, and added, “So I guess that all of you here actually moved away from this village sixteen years ago. If my guess is valid, then using the time calculation, those who still have memories of this village should be three out of the seven of us!” He narrowed his eyes seriously, “That woman from yesterday, you,” Here he paused and looked up at Xiao Chen, “and him.” 



Ma Chenggong’s pupils shrank sharply, and his two hands clenched into fists. 

Hu Bing’s brain was surprisingly clear as he continued, “Combining yesterday’s accident, I have a bold idea.”

Jin Hong and the others held their breath and stared at him with undivided attention.

“Cannibalism. There are many records of it in history, even dating back to ancient times. No matter what dynasty it is, once there’s a famine, it’s easy for people to eat each other, and the phenomenon of human cannibalism will be endless!” He paused, “I am certain that sixteen years ago, during the famine, there was cannibalism in this village.”

The crowd sucked in a breath of cold air and kept quiet. 

Even Ma Hang couldn’t help but cover his mouth and nose, turning back with a horrified look on his face, and couldn’t help but look at his brother.

Ma Chenggong looked ashen and pondered for two seconds, quirking his lips in mockery, “Yes, your guesses are all right!”

Xiao Chen didn’t make a sound as if he was an outsider and looked at Ma Chenggong with cold eyes.

As though Hu Bing had suddenly thought of something, he scowled slightly, “You, all of you, only came back after receiving the letter, right?”

The people looked at each other and nodded their heads.

Hu Bing pulled out the letter from his pocket, “That’s strange, how did they know where we live!”

Ma Chenggong was in a state of shock when he heard that.

Yes. 

It was too strange!

He simply didn’t believe that an ordinary village chief in such a remote village could find out where so many people lived.

Ma Chenggong exhaled, his hands trembled a bit.

There was even a clipped picture of him eating someone years ago! He simply couldn’t refuse! He had to come back! 

The moment he was reborn, he realized that it was all just a trap by Tan Jun!

Ma Chenggong wanted to tell the truth, but the words were stuck in his throat, like phlegm. He tried to cough it out but couldn’t, he opened his mouth and closed it again.

What can he say?

Tell them that they’re facing a death sentence, that this village is cursed, that ghosts are coming to claim their lives? Tell them he was born again? That’s how you know the truth? 

He couldn’t speak, nor could he say it.

Ma Chenggong glanced at Xiao Chen, and his heart trembled a bit.

He wasn’t sure if Xiao Chen knew the truth about what he had done to him back then.

If he knew, he would never let himself go! 

As for Zhang Xiaoxian…

Ma Chenggong clenched his teeth.

It wasn’t a wrongful death either.

Ma Chenggong crossed his arms and clasped his fingers together. His elbows rested on the dining table, and his forehead leaned on his hands as if he was meditating. It was only when one looked closely could they see that his fingers were shaking. 

“Boy Ma, thanks to you. This is a reward for you!” The man pulled out a piece of meat from the pot. Without taking a plate, the man just cut it off with a knife and handed it to the boy.

The boy’s hands were shaking, his two eyes were like a blind person’s, he couldn’t blink, and his body was frozen in place.

He was dumbfounded as he grasped the raw meat handed to him by the man with both hands.

This meat was fresh, and there was still blood on the meat. When the boy held it in his hands, the blood ran straight down his wrist and even dripped onto his shoes. 

When the man saw him like this, he wasn’t dissatisfied and said, “Take this piece of meat and eat it with your brother, haven’t you two been hungry for a long time?”

The boy seemed to suddenly realize something. A shudder ran through his body, and his eyes were a little strained. Then, he looked left and right twice. His hands were like holding some kind of treasure, and he was holding it tightly in his arms for fear of being taken away.

He quickly walked in the direction of the door. With a “puffing” sound, he directly collided with the person in front of him, but he managed to hold the meat tightly and did not let it fly out.

Ma Chenggong raised his head and looked. 

It was a girl.

This girl looked to be about sixteen or seventeen years old but was wearing clothes that were not suitable for her. It showed off her thighs and waist. She even wore heavy makeup, but he had to admit, she did look beautiful.

The girl stood up from the floor and looked at Ma Chenggong coldly. She tossed her hair and twisted her waist in a flirtatious manner to continue walking inside, not caring at all about Ma Chenggong’s strange eyes.

Ma Chenggong stood up, turned back, and looked behind the door. He could hear the sound of the girl kissing the man after she entered the door. 

Ma Chenggong knew the girl, who was known as a socialite in this town. As long as there was food, he could sleep with her for the night.

In times like these, he was not ashamed of such tactics.

Don’t people live just so they can have a meal?

Oh yes, he remembered, this girl was called Zhang Xiaoxian. 

Hu Bing’s probing gaze landed on Xiao Chen’s body, sweeping his eyes up and down his body, sizing him up, “You’re anorexic, right?”

Xiao Chen’s face cracked slightly, and he raised his head to meet Hu Bing’s eyes.

Hu Bing didn’t flinch but instead met his eyes seriously. “I’ve observed that you’ve barely eaten anything in the past two days. I even saw you hyperventilating early this morning.”

“It’s because of the aftermath of living in this village, isn’t it?” Hu Bing hit the nail on the head and stared at Xiao Chen with a burning gaze. 

Xiao Chen’s fingers squeezed the pendant he wore around his neck. When he heard the word ‘aftermath’, his fingers tightened, and his face was suddenly incomparably pale.

Hu Bing narrowed his eyes and moved his eyes back from Xiao Chen, “This village reveals a strong sense of strangeness! Haven’t you noticed? Although the old people here are no different from ordinary old people, their hands and feet are surprisingly agile. The village chief we met on our first day here, as well as that old man yesterday, their ability to walk and even their strength, are not inferior to those in their prime.”

Jin Hong nodded, blinked, and clutched her sleeve nervously. As though she had thought of something, she pursed her lips and anxiously said, “Do you think that these old people have eaten all the young people in the village? That’s why we didn’t see any young people from the moment we entered the village?”

The words awakened the people in the room. 

Ma Hang sucked in a breath of cold air, and Huang Ke’s face directly lost its color in fright.

Ma Chenggong’s expression didn’t change much, and his two hands clenched tightly.

Hu Bing nodded, “I think so.” He pondered for a while and said, “All in all, we must not sit idly by. We must find the secrets of this village!”

Xiao Chen covered his mouth and nose with the collar of his turtleneck sweater. 

The laws of nature, karma, are like the shadows, and it’s not pleasant at all.

Who is to blame? These old people?

They’re the ones who got themselves into this!

— 

“Where did this come from?” Xiao Chen was a little surprised and pointed to the sweets that had been hidden in his suitcase.

Tan Jun blinked and put his hands on his chin, sitting down on the chair, and foolishly said, “You eat it, didn’t you like sweet treats the most when you were little?”

Xiao Chen was lost for words, and his nose was a little sour. He silently moved a chair from the side to sit beside him, examining his face carefully.

It was like a dream. 

He had never thought he would see Tan Jun again.

This feeling was so subtle that it made him feel that it was unreal. Even when he went to sleep and woke up these past few days, he would wonder if Tan Jun’s appearance was a beautiful dream of his or if he had some kind of imaginary illness.

Xiao Chen was fascinated, his eyes were deep and devoted, and they were shining like there were stars in them.

Tan Jun’s face was burning. He wouldn’t have felt this way, but when Xiao Chen’s eyes fell on him, he felt like he was drugged, and his brain was in an indescribable state of pleasure. 

He gently rested his head on Xiao Chen’s lap, looking very obedient, like a puppy waiting for his master’s touch.

Xiao Chen was stunned.

This was the most common position they had used when they were kids.

Xiao Chen’s eyes ached, and he let out a breath. His hand gently stroked Tan Jun’s hair like he was coaxing a child. It was a strange feeling, Tan Jun’s condensed entity that only he could see and touch; Xiao Chen sounded a little choked up, “Why are you still the same as when you were a child?” 

Tan Jun lifted his eyes to lock gazes with Xiao Chen, who had his head bowed, and softly said, “In front of you, I will never change.”

The same goes for everything I’ve said.



“I just walked around the whole village, and I found a strange point. In every house, there is only one old man living there at most,” Hu Bing narrowed his eyes, and his expression was heavy. 

Jin Hong nodded, looking a little agitated, “Yes, what’s even stranger is that there are no women in this village at all!!!” Speaking of which, she shuddered as she was currently the only female in the entire team. Not to mention, the last one who died, Zhang Xiaoxian, was also a woman!

In this case, then, she was in a very dangerous position!

Ma Hang nodded and nervously said, “I also found a strange thing when I just went to look around. In common people’s homes, especially in small towns and rural areas, the lobby of every home is supposed to have pictures of their dead ancestors! But there were none in the ones I just went to see! I also noticed that there aren’t even any graves here! So where are those dead people buried?”

Ma Chenggong remained silent from start to finish, not participating in their discussion, and even looked a bit dejected. 

Huang Ke came in from the front door with a pale face; cold sweat kept coming out, his hands were trembling. He felt his legs weaken and almost fell to his knees in the next second.

Hu Bing frowned and grabbed his arm to prevent him from falling.

“What’s wrong?” Jin Hong was shocked by Huang Ke’s appearance and hurriedly asked.

Huang Ke’s throat moved; it was as if he was scared silly. He took a couple of breaths before he came back to his senses, and his voice was still a bit weak, “I just saw those people eating…”

His words didn’t come out completely, but the crowd understood what he meant in seconds.

Huang Ke looked like he was about to cry, “And that village chief! I saw it! That village chief’s corpse was eaten by them!”

!!!

That explains it all! 

No wonder his body vanished into thin air!

Hu Bing thought about the situation and released Huang Ke. His eyes darted around, and his expression was solemn.

No, no! There’s something else that doesn’t make any sense!

How exactly did the village chief die? Why can’t they get out of this village no matter how far they walk? 

It’s too weird! There’s nothing that seems to be man-made about it!

Thinking of this, Hu Bing paused, “I think we’re missing a critical point!”

The crowd looked at him.

“That’s this place we’re living in now!” Hu Bing narrowed his eyes and explained, “This house we’re staying in is the village chief’s house, and the day we arrived, he had clearly assigned us the keys to our rooms and warned us not to go up to the second floor! Right?!” 

Jin Hong and Ma Hang nodded hurriedly.

“So we haven’t been observing this house properly at all these past few days! Not to mention, no one has ever been on the second floor!” Hu Bing swept a glance at the crowd’s expressions and said, “I feel that if we want to explore the truth about this village, then we must start with this house!”

Xiao Chen was sitting against the wall, his eyes downcast, and his bangs were half-covering his eyes. His hands were still covered with gloves, and his expression was aloof. He looked like he had no intention of participating in their conversation.

He suddenly felt a bit itchy on his palm, like someone was writing on it with their finger. Xiao Chen was taken aback, carefully feeling the touch on his palm and trying to identify the words. 

‘Go.’

Xiao Chen was stunned.

Hu Bing was planning to assign a task and pointed at Ma Hang, but before he could make a sound, Xiao Chen suddenly stood up and looked at him. His expression was still blank, but his voice was clear, “I’m going too.”

Ma Chenggong immediately raised his head when he heard Xiao Chen’s voice, his eyes carrying a complex look that he couldn’t hide. The moment Xiao Chen’s gaze swept over him slightly, he lowered his head in panic. 

Hu Bing looked at Xiao Chen and then at Ma Chenggong. Not knowing what to think, he nodded, “Okay, let’s go together!”

The stairs in this house were made of old wooden material with a thick layer of dust piled on top, the handrails even had some mold on them, and the boards didn’t look very strong as they were crooked.

A slight step on it would make a creaking sound.

Xiao Chen walked along behind, the last one was Huang Ke, and there was a safe distance between them. 

Xiao Chen turned back and glanced at Huang Ke, not knowing why there was an unexplainable sense of conflict.

There were only two rooms on the second floor, but each room came with a lock, which was one of those very old locks with a chain. The walls on the second floor were also somewhat cracked and even blackened. Before they could put their feet on the second floor, they could already smell a strange moldy odor, which was very unpleasant and a bit fishy, like the foul smell of dead fish.

Hu Bing and Ma Hang looked at each other and pushed hard on the door. The result was obvious; it couldn’t be opened.

Hu Bing waved his hand, gesturing for the crowd to back off, intending to break down the doors and enter. 

Although these doors were old, they were surprisingly solid. No matter how much they kicked or even smashed them with a chair, they couldn’t damage them in the slightest.

“Damn.” Ma Hang cursed lowly, looking a little uneasy.

Jin Hong and Huang Ke were also a little anxious.

Hu Bing frowned, his brain started to scour for clues. 

Just when the crowd was at their wit’s end and even planning to find another way out and leave, Xiao Chen felt as if something was tugging at his hand to walk towards the door.

Xiao Chen complied with the feeling and walked to the door.

He looked at the anxious crowd, then at his own palm, blinked, and tried to put his hand on the door handle.

“Clack.” The chains instantly fell apart. 

The door opened.

“….”

“….”

For a moment, there was silence. 

Ma Hang, who looked in disbelief, strode forward, picked up the chain that had fallen to the ground, and tugged on it. He even moved his mouth directly to bite it but only managed to bite out a layer of rust.

He opened his eyes wide, looking at Xiao Chen like he was a monster.

Jin Hong opened her mouth, apparently still not having recovered from the images she had just seen.

Hu Bing, however, reacted quickly and walked straight in. He glanced at Xiao Chen and intended to open the door. 

Xiao Chen didn’t make a sound and stepped back to the side.

He felt something leaning on his shoulder, affectionately rubbing against his neck.

Jin Hong followed Hu Bing’s footsteps intending to go in. When she reached the door and got a good look inside, she instantly squealed in fear.

Ma Hang, who was standing next to her, was shocked by her screams and trembled. 

Hu Bing was the first person to see what the inside looked like, and his face was a bit ugly, even pale, to say the least.

The room was devoid of any furniture, the floor was covered with straw mats, and the walls were covered in mildew. The stench was even stronger when the door was opened as there were four corpses on the floor!

The remains weren’t complete; they were mostly in bits and pieces. It was rather like someone had deliberately put together the shape of the bones to make a human shape, and the corpses were nearly thoroughly corroded.

Jin Hong forced herself to calm down and patted her chest in an attempt to get her heart rate down. She tugged on Hu Bing’s sleeve and followed in, observing the corpse and said, “It’s a man, a woman, an old woman, and an old man.” 

Hu Bing raised his eyebrows and looked at her.

Jin Hong didn’t hide anything, “I’m a medical student!”

“This, this wouldn’t be that village chief’s family, would it?” Ma Hang covered his nose and mouth and was a little alarmed to hear Jin Hong’s words.

The answer was obvious. 

“Were they killed by the village chief?” Ma Hang raised his head, his pupils shook, and he looked at the crowd as if searching for recognition.

Jin Hong calmly analyzed, “The village chief might have eaten them!”

Hu Bing was silent and seemed to agree with Jin Hong, but his frustration could be seen in his eyebrows. Finally, he turned back to the crowd, “Have you guys heard of the Werther Effect?”

Xiao Chen’s footsteps stopped at the door. Surprisingly, he, who has always been silent, spoke out when he heard Hu Bing’s words. “The Werther Effect is taken from the German writer Goethe’s work, “The Sorrows of Young Werther”. This one ends with the main character committing suicide. After it was published, it triggered a wave of suicides throughout Europe, so this effect was called the Werther Effect. “Xiao Chen’s voice was faint, and his eyes met Hu Bing’s. 

Hu Bing nodded his head and calmly said, “Robert Cialdini’s “Influence” book mentioned the “Principle of Social Identity”, which distinguishes between the individual consciousness and the collective consciousness. That is to say when people are in an environment where they share the same beliefs, values, and behavioral orientations, their collective behavior will influence the way individuals behave. This principle is consistent with the Werther Effect!”

He paused, his expression solemn, “Based on this principle, we can go ahead and analyze these unreasonable behaviors in this village. In their collective consciousness, cannibalism has become a normal part of their lives!”



Jin Hong clenched her fist and was in disbelief when this statement was said. 

What kind of society was this! How can such a barbaric social identity still exist?

Ma Hang was a little nauseous, and after a couple of glances at the door, he couldn’t stand it any longer and walked out.

Huang Ke’s throat moved, and he was surprisingly quiet when he heard Hu Bing’s words. The youngest one’s stress reaction was not even as intense as Ma Hang’s.

Xiao Chen’s expression was considered cold, using his collar to block his nose, as if he could not stand the smell of the room a bit. 

The man who had been staying downstairs, Ma Chenggong, actually didn’t know when he came up. When he saw the scene inside the room, he was first slightly shocked and then frowned. Still, his heart had a mysteriously unexpected and reasonable feeling about this picture.

Hu Bing swept over the crowd and said, “Let’s go, let’s go to the other room.”

This time, after just leaving the room, except for Ma Chenggong, who intentionally or unintentionally avoided Xiao Chen’s line of sight, everyone’s eyes landed on Xiao Chen’s body for a moment as they walked to the other door.

“….”

Xiao Chen was stared at in silence. He paused and walked up. After taking two steps, he suddenly felt someone place a light kiss on his left ear, causing him to tremble and the tips of his ears to turn a little red.

‘So cute.’ Xiao Chen heard the person leaning against his ear.

Xiao Chen pursed his lips, and he didn’t let his cold expression crack.

‘Behave yourself.’ There was a bit of coaxing and somewhat coquettishness in his tone. 

‘Fine.’ The man laughed lightly.

Xiao Chen’s hand touched the chain cautiously.

“Clack.” The iron chain split apart once again.

“;” 

Everyone had a really mysterious feeling arise inside of them.

Xiao Chen retracted his gaze, intending to retreat to the side. He heard the man say in his ear, Am I being good?’

“Let’s go.” Hu Bing’s eyes swept over Xiao Chen and withdrew his gaze. He was still the one to walk first.

Jin Hong kept giving herself hints in her heart, even preparing herself to see ghosts, trying to calm down in case she saw something unusual again. 

Surprisingly, when the door opened, the scene inside couldn’t have been more normal.

There was a bed, a table, and a chair in the room. The bed was piled with many clothes that teenage boys wear. It was probably because this room had not been opened for a long time that it was piled with dust. There were also many books and school supplies on the table.

Hu Bing looked around the room and pursed his lips a little.

Xiao Chen didn’t believe that Tan Jun had sent him up here without a purpose, so he observed in the doorway for two seconds and directly started to turn over the table. 

It was also simply because he wore gloves, so it wouldn’t make him feel bad when he touched the things in this room.

The people around him saw him like this and began to search the room for clues.

Jin Hong opened the drawer, and what caught her eye was a black leather book. The paper was yellowed, and it looked very old.

She picked it up and flipped through it. When she got a good look at what was inside, she stiffened. Even her hand became unsteady with the book. 

(1) I’ve been hungry for days and could only manage to eat Guanyin clay, but my stomach became like a balloon, and I’ve been constipated for a whole week…

(2) It’s so strange. Mom said she was going to follow Grandpa to get food, but Grandpa came back in the evening, and Mom didn’t.

(3) It was a great day today because Grandpa got meat from somewhere, it’s probably the first time I’ve eaten meat in years. I’ve forgotten what it tasted like, and it’s a little hard to bite into. Grandpa said it’s because it’s raw meat, but that’s okay, it tastes better than the Guanyin clay, cotton, and bark I’ve been eating.

(4) Dad won’t let me go out now, saying it’s dangerous out there. Even the uncles I know have told me to go around them so that I won’t get caught by them.

I miss Mom so much.

(5) I’m so scared now. I saw Fatty being killed with a knife by his father’s hand…

(6) Grandma told me that our village was cursed, one by one the people in the village disappeared!

(7) Grandma is also missing today…

The handwriting on the black leather book wasn’t very good. It was written crookedly, and some of the words were a little hard to identify.

Hu Bing snatched the black leather book and flipped through its contents, his expression growing more and more serious.

“Our suspicions were right.” Hu Bing’s voice was low. Although he was mature, in the end, he was still only a boy in his early twenties, and his emotions were inevitably a bit unstable.

The crowd gathered around and flipped through the black leather book. The atmosphere became somewhat depressed. 

Hu Bing seemed to have suddenly reacted to something, his expression instantly horrified, “Wait a minute! In the next room are two old people and a couple, but this room is a child’s room, so where did the child go?”

Jin Hong was all over the place, her eyes trembled, coming back to her senses, “No, no, if those four people in the other room are a family, what role does the village chief play?”

When Ma Hang heard this, his eyes instantly widened, and cold sweat couldn’t stop coming out of his head. He felt a little chilled from the bottom of his heart. Ma Hang swallowed his saliva, and his legs began to tremble.

Huang Ke paled and did not know what to think. 

Hu Bing pursed his lips, his heartbeat began to speed up wildly, his hands trembled a bit, and his body was becoming a bit weak. Something flashed in his mind, and his eyes contracted sharply. He raised his head, looked at the crowd, and said, “Everyone, I have a bold guess.”

The crowd looked at him in confusion.

“Could it be,” he paused, “Could it be that the village chief is this child who wrote the diary?”

“What?” Jin Hong blurted out in shock, finding it hard to accept at all, and quickly denied, “How is it possible? Based on the timing, if this child is still alive, he would be no more than thirty years old now! How could he be an old man?” 

Hu Bing shook his head and squared off, “Have you heard of Nguyen Thi Phuong?”

“Who?” Ma Hang didn’t hear the name clearly and frowned at the question.

But as soon as Jin Hong heard the name, she immediately covered her mouth and nose and screamed out.

“The case of the Vietnamese woman Nguyen Thi Phuong is famous in medical history,” Jin Hong calmed down, “She suffered from a very rare skin disease. In an extremely short period of time, her skin rapidly aged and wrinkled. She was only twenty-six years old, but she looked to be around seventy years old.” 

Hu Bing nodded, “Yes, and to this day, they couldn’t uncover the real cause. There are two conjectures in the medical community. One is that she has an allergic reaction to seafood, and the other is that she is suffering from a lipid secretion disease.”

Ma Hang was confused but understood most of what was being said, “You mean to say that the village chief has this disease and his true age is only thirty?”

Hu Bing sneered, narrowed his eyes, and shook his head, “No, more than that; I think all the people in this village have this disease!”



Ma Chenggong opened his mouth wide at the words, his expression all becoming frightened. 

What was going on? He didn’t even know this before he was reborn!

Xiao Chen, who heard Hu Bing’s analysis, slowly raised his head. His expression was also slightly surprised, but there was not much change because he was more concerned about another matter than this one.

From the moment he entered the door, his heart was somewhat panicked, and this panic came from the pendant around his neck. He could feel the pendant becoming agitated.

‘On the bed.’ Tan Jun leaned into his ear and exhaled with a bit of teasing in his tone. 

Xiao Chen swept a glance at the crowd and pretended to walk carelessly to the bed while the others were still lost in their thoughts.

Xiao Chen’s eyes were sharp, and he almost immediately saw what kind of thing was under the clothes.

He cautiously glanced at everyone, and with a quick look, he pulled the thing out from underneath the clothes.

It was a bit hard.

It was a human bone.

Xiao Chen’s heart pounded, and his hand trembled. The next second, the bone was immediately grasped tightly and secretly stuffed into the sleeve of the trench coat that he was wearing today.

Xiao Chen’s breathing became a little short, his other hand nervously pendant. In his heart, he anxiously asked, as if he was very concerned about the answer, “Is this yours?”

Tan Jun stared at the side of Xiao Chen’s face and smiled lightly. His right hand suddenly attached to the other’s waist, Xiao Chen shivered at the sudden touch. 

And his other hand smoothly grabbed Xiao Chen’s hand that was clutching the pendant and held it tightly.

Tan Jun kissed the back of Xiao Chen’s head and then his left ear, “This is my thirteenth rib, did you know that?”

He was referring to the pendant around Xiao Chen’s neck.

In the Bible, it is written that God took the thirteenth rib from the body of the first human, Adam, and created a new human, Eve. 

Eve eventually became Adam’s wife.

Xiao Chen’s gaze was slowly placed on the pendant around his neck, and his fingers couldn’t help but tighten even more.

Tan Jun seemed to feel the strength in his hand and let out a soft laugh in his ear.

Xiao Chen’s eyes dropped, and his throat moved. 

Yes, this wasn’t an ordinary pendant.

It was a sickle pendant that he had carved using Tan Jun’s bones.

Xiao Chen closed his eyes.

It was carved out bit by bit according to the drawing he made! 

‘So,’ Xiao Chen sucked in a breath as if he was relieved, ‘So you know.’

He only came back for one reason. The letter said he could get back the rest of Tan Jun’s bones!

Although he knew it was impossible, and the outcome would be even more unlikely, he still came back.

Even with the possibility of gaining absolutely nothing, he had returned to the place where he once vowed never to come back. 

Tan Jun chuckled lightly without answering.

Of course, I know.

I’ve known everything since you came back here.

The world kisses me with pain and asks me to sing in return. 

And the only one I repay with a song is you.

Hu Bing glanced at Xiao Chen, who was not looking well. He looked strangely at Xiao Chen’s abnormal reaction before turning to the crowd, “Now, let’s go look for any more clues in this village.”

Ma Hang nodded and saw Ma Chenggong, who looked out of sorts next to him. He walked over, frowned, and asked, “Brother, are you okay?”

Ma Chenggong seemed to be too engrossed in his thoughts and shivered when Ma Hang touched his arm. 

“I’m fine.” Ma Chenggong glanced at him with sweaty palms.

He pursed his lips and began to remember his previous life.

He was the fourth to die out of the seven.

The first was Xiao Chen, the second was Zhang Xiaoxian, the third was Jin Hong, and the fourth was himself. 

He survived until everyone was going crazy, with no food, the threat of death, and a bunch of strange old men in the village waiting for an opportunity to take their lives.

Thinking of this, he looked at Ma Hang.

What he found most unbearable was Ma Hang’s attitude.

When they were starving to madness, Ma Hang actually cut off his left hand with a kitchen knife while he was asleep! Ate his flesh! Drank his blood! 

He clutched his hand in resentment at the thought of it.

But.

Ma Chenggong took a deep breath.

The younger brother in front of him had not done or known anything. There was no way he could hate or blame him. 

There was no way for him to get back at someone who knew nothing.

Huang Ke walked at the end of the crowd, and when he reached the stairs, he couldn’t help but look back at the room where the bones were piled up.

His eyes narrowed slightly, and his expression was somewhat cold, even revealing a bit of resentment. It was an expression that had an inexplicable sense of violation on his young face. Still, he quickly restrained this look and walked down the stairs as if nothing had happened.

The wind blew slightly, splashing the yellow dust on the ground. 

Jin Hong hid behind Hu Bing, then said nervously, “Is it my illusion? Why do I feel like there are fewer people in the village?”

Hu Bing was silent. He looked around and said, “No.”

“The number of people in the village are really getting less.”

Xiao Chen put his hands in his pockets and lowered his eyes, still holding the bone in the palm of his right hand. 

‘Tan Jun.’ Xiao Chen grasped the pendant with his left hand, calling for him in his heart.

‘What.’ Xiao Chen felt someone put both hands on his shoulders, then hooked his neck. It was like holding a large doll as the person enveloped him in his arms, placing his chin in Xiao Chen’s hair and replied softly in his ear.

Xiao Chen choked, burying half his face in his collar. He gripped the object on his right hand, ‘Where are the rest of your bones?’

Tan Jun paused, sounding like he didn’t really care, ‘I don’t know.’ 

Xiao Chen fiercely raised his head, and because of his speed, the top of his head directly hit the other party’s chin. Tan Jun didn’t hide, and it was as if he was afraid that Xiao Chen’s bump hurt, so he gently touched his head.

It was also fortunate that no one was placing their eyes on Xiao Chen at this time.

Xiao Chen felt a little difficult and muffled his voice, ‘It’s all my fault! I shouldn’t have left.”

He was too scared to crawl out and hid under the bed all day and night, starving until his stomach began to convulse and his body was near fainting. 

He only picked up one of Tan Jun’s bones, which he always wore around his neck. He didn’t dare to forget it, nor did he want to.

Whenever he couldn’t hold on any longer, he only needed to think of Tan Jun so that he could hold on.

Tan Jun looked at him with some heartache in his eyes and softly said, “Don’t blame yourself. You’ve done a good job!”

Hu Bing’s expression slowly became a little anxious. He knew that time waited for no one, and spending it, again and again, was simply not an option. 

Ma Chenggong gritted his teeth, and his expression was a bit grim like he was having some mental struggle. Finally, he raised his head and said, “Don’t you ever feel that everything we’ve experienced is like a supernatural event?”

Hu Bing looked back at him.

Ma Hang opened his mouth wide and called out in surprise, “Brother?”

Ma Chenggong calmly said, “The village chief suddenly died in front of us, and we can’t get out of this town no matter how much we walk. Don’t you suspect that there are so many unexplained phenomena in the village?” 

Hu Bing remained silent and locked eyes with Ma Chenggong. What Ma Chenggong was saying were things that he found simply unreasonable to explain.

But before Hu Bing could reply, a sound immediately drew the attention of the crowd.

Hu Bing made a hush gesture, put his index finger to the people, and whispered, “I’m going to check it out first, don’t move.”

Jin Hong and Ma Hang both nodded their heads. 

Hu Bing approached the source of the sound, trying to discern what the words from afar were saying.

“Although the skin is a bit loose, it’s still meat, not bad.”

The old man squatted on the ground, holding a sharp kitchen knife in his hand and rubbing it repeatedly on the whetstone.

Next to him was a frying pan placed on the earthen floor, with a wood fire burning underneath and sparks sputtering out. 

Hu Bing hid in the corner, with half his head sticking out, observing the scene.

Next to the oil pan was a long wooden chair, the kind of chair that could only be seen in the countryside. The seat panels were grey, and the size of it was one and three meters long.

It couldn’t be more ordinary.

Provided, of course, that there wasn’t a dead man lying in the chair. 

This man had his arms and legs spread out, his entire body undressed, and was lying naked on the chair. From chest to waist, his whole body had been stabbed and gutted with a knife.

On the ground, there was blood all over, as well as many piles of internal organs, all slimy and sticky. What was even more disgusting was that the intestines carried thin pieces of feces next to them.

When Hu Bing saw this scene, he immediately turned around. He held onto the wall next to him, and his stomach began to pound acid and make him vomit.

His body began to tremble as well. 

He recognized the man lying on the bench almost immediately!

It was the old man that knocked on the door last time and brought Zhang Xiaoxian’s meat!

There’s no way he could be wrong!

Hu Bing intended to retreat, but he was so nervous that he stomped on a dead tree branch directly beside him, creating a loud clattering sound. 

The sound of sharpening knives came to an abrupt halt.

Hu Bing stiffened, his lips turned white and quivered. He could feel his heartbeat thumping loudly and felt that his throat was about to jump out!

The man seemed to stand up on his feet as footsteps sounded.

Hu Bing’s cold sweat ran down, and his hands began to tremble uncontrollably. 

The sound was getting closer!

It’s coming over!!!

“Puff!” The old man grabbed the knife and smashed it into the wall. He turned around the corner, laughed hideously, and whispered, “Is it a cute little kitten?”

Hu Bing gawked. The old man’s face was leaning towards his face! The distance between them was only around twenty centimeters! 

It’s over!

Hu Bing’s heart pounded.

The old man’s smile stiffened, and he took his hand off the wall, his eyes burning with anger, “What’s going on! Why is there no one!!!”

The old man spoke and spat air that directly smashed into Hu Bing’s neck. Hu Bing felt cold, his legs trembled, and he almost fell on his knees. 

The old man narrowed his eyes, snorted, put the knife away, and turned back around again.

Hu Bing’s eyes were a little dizzy, and his eyelids were covered in cold sweat.

What was going on?

Before he could think about it, a voice came directly from his mind. 

“Want to live?”

This voice was very deep, even a little cold. It had a flat tone, like the Lord of Hell who would judge people to death and kill without blinking an eye.



Hu Bing covered his mouth and nose as his eyes widened. 

He heard that cold voice spreading from his mind. It sounded indifferent as if it didn’t care if he lived or died, ‘If you want to live, burn the whole place down.’

Hu Bing was horrified, his pupils contracted sharply, and his fingers clenched. As his body was still in the aftershocks of what he had just experienced, he asked with a trembling heart, ‘Who are you?’ Why should I believe you?’

The man sneered as if he had heard a funny joke of some sort. After a pause, his voice grew colder, and it was chilling, ‘You think you have another choice?’

Hu Bing was instantly silenced. 

The answer was obvious.

No.

Hu Bing’s throat was dry as he forced himself to calm down.

He simply couldn’t trust someone who doesn’t know anything about the situation! And he doesn’t believe that there’s such a good thing that would come out of nowhere!

Nothing is ever without a demand!

Hu Bing breathed and calmly asked in his mind, ‘Do you have any conditions? I don’t believe you would help me for no reason!’

The man yawned, the sound seemed to be piercing, and it was very hard to bear.

Hu Bing heard the man say, ‘You’re smart.’ 

Hu Bing’s heart instantly tensed.

The man continued to speak, ‘I only need you to do one thing, and then you can leave here without any problems.’

Hu Bing’s veins popped, and he was a little stiff as he listened carefully to the man’s demand.

‘Take care of Xiao Chen.’ Five words, simple and straightforward. 

The amazing thing was that when he mentioned Xiao Chen, his tone instantly changed. It carried an indescribable taste, like the return of spring after the ice had melted.

Hu Bing was shocked.

What?

Xiao Chen? 

—

With sharp eyes, Jin Hong saw Hu Bing’s figure and immediately stood up from the ground.

Hu Bing’s face was pale and looked a bit strange. Once he returned, he couldn’t help but glance at Xiao Chen repeatedly, as if there were some questions he wanted to ask but didn’t dare to.

Jin Hong saw him like this and asked, “What’s wrong? Did you find something?” 

Hu Bing stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, which were so dry that they were about to crack. He forced a smile and said with a ghastly face, “Someone there has murdered and is cooking.”

He paused, his expression somewhat weak, “The one that died was the old man who killed Zhang Xiaoxian.”

Ma Chenggong’s eyelids fluttered at the words.

“What should we do next?” When Jin Hong heard this, she became dazed. She was mumbling to himself, and her eyes began to empty as if her entire body had wilted. 

Ma Hang was a little scared and grabbed his brother’s arm, and the latter showed a complicated expression.

The atmosphere was frozen.

Just as the situation reached a deadlock, Huang Ke, who was squatting on the side, suddenly stood up. He swept a glance at the crowd and coldly spoke, “In this world, everything is a cycle of cause and effect.”

Hu Bing opened his mouth and looked at him stiffly. 

Huang Ke’s expression was bland, as if he was talking about a simple family matter. This expression matched the atmosphere and had an unexplainable sense of violation.

Huang Ke didn’t care much about the crowd’s gaze and said, “Nobody in this village is a good person! We don’t know how many people they’ve killed and how much evil they’ve done to survive, but as long as they keep eating people, there will only be two outcomes for these villagers.”

Saying this, Huang Ke paused slightly, narrowed his eyes, and said, “Either they continue to rely on cannibalism for survival or be eaten by others.”

He paused again, and a sarcastic smile tugged at the corners of his mouth, “Here, no one is clean! Want to live! Want to get out of here! Don’t you get it? Unless they’re all dead, unless this village disappears completely, we can’t get out of here at all! If our previous assumptions are true, these old people aren’t old at all. They’re obviously cursed! It’s all karma! It’s the dead ones who are taking revenge on them!!!” 

Ma Chenggong and Hu Bing’s hearts pounded at the same time.

Ma Chenggong was shocked by what Huang Ke said about the curse theory, which corresponded with his thoughts. On the other hand, Hu Bing was already in a bit of a state of shock and then was directly pierced by his theory about the village disappearing.

“So, what do we do now?” Ma Hang looked a little shaken. He looked at Huang Ke in horror and asked with urgency.

This time, both Hu Bing and Ma Chenggong chose to remain silent. 

Huang Ke squinted his eyes, seeming like he knew something, and only said one word, “Wait.”

Hu Bing looked at him somewhat strangely. The latter’s expression was indifferent and didn’t look like he wanted to explain.

Jin Hong’s heart was beating very fast; she stared at Huang Ke’s face, feeling like she didn’t know this boy in front of her. Obviously, he was the youngest one out of everyone. Her impression of him was still when he was about to cry after seeing the murder scene. However, this expression, this demeanor he had now, didn’t look like he didn’t know anything.

Jin Hong couldn’t help but mutter in her heart. 

Does this Huang Ke know something?

There was another moment of silence, and the atmosphere was a bit stiff.

Huang Ke pursed his lips and glanced at the crowd. His gaze unconsciously lingered on Xiao Chen’s body for a moment longer, and his eyes had a complicated, unexplainable emotion.

Xiao Chen’s gaze met with Huang Ke’s, and the latter quickly avoided his look with a jolt. 

Xiao Chen’s eyes narrowed, sensing that something was wrong.

It was a little strange.

Huang Ke’s eyes made him feel uncomfortable, but there was an inexplicably familiar feeling.

‘Do I know him?’ Xiao Chen asked Tan Jun. 

Tan Jun was strangely silent for a few seconds, not knowing what to think about. He seemed to be deliberating over the words before saying an ambiguous sentence, ‘You don’t know him, but he knows you.’

Xiao Chen scowled, ‘What?’

‘Do you know who he is?’ Tan Jun asked him back.

Xiao Chen felt a little strange, not understanding why he was asking, ‘I don’t know.’ 

‘Then, do you know how old he is?’ Tan Jun’s hand rested on Xiao Chen’s shoulder.

Xiao Chen scanned Huang Ke’s entire body as he glanced at him and said, ‘Fifteen or sixteen years old.’

‘Heh,’ Tan Jun laughed, his voice was flat, ‘His surname is Huang, and he’s fifteen or sixteen years old, guess whose son he is.”

As Xiao Chen listened, his expression suddenly turned pale, and his fingers curled. On the other hand, Tan Jun’s fingers gently stroked the top of his head, trying to reassure him. 

Surname Huang, fifteen or sixteen years old…

Is he that man’s son? The man who killed Tan Jun!

Xiao Chen’s pupils shook, his hands clenched, and his eyelashes quivered.

Tan Jun circled Xiao Chen gently in his arms, his eyes narrowed, and his gaze darted to Huang Ke. Huang Ke’s eyes glanced at Xiao Chen just in time, and as if he saw something, he stared sharply and lowered his head quickly. 

Heh.

‘You like him?’

Huang Ke’s body was shaking a little, and he couldn’t stop the cold sweat from flowing down his forehead as he tried to hold back his panic and cover his chest.

‘I don’t dare.’ Huang Ke argued in his heart. 

‘Heh, you don’t dare!’ Tan Jun’s deep voice penetrated straight through Huang Ke’s heart with a sneer, but he couldn’t conceal his possessiveness more than that.

Huang Ke tried to restrain the oppressive feeling, bracing his palms against the wall and sticking his fingers right into it.

‘Heh.’ The man let out a sneer and continued to speak, ‘You have all the memories of my past with him. From the time you were born into this world, your mission was to find him for me! I searched for him for sixteen years, and you loved him for sixteen years!”

Huang Ke’s lips turned white and began to tremble. Finally, he could no longer hold on, his legs weakened, and he knelt to the ground. 

He heard the man coldly attached to his ear for a long time, fiercely saying, ‘This is my last warning to you!’

—

Worn and deserted.

The silence revealed something strange. 

With only the wind rustling the dead leaves on the ground, there was a sudden rush of footsteps outside the door. The sound was a bit chaotic, and it didn’t sound like there was only one person.

“Bang, bang, bang!” There was a violent knock on the door.

Everyone looked at each other with more than a little caution.

“There’s someone.” Hu Bing made a deep voice and clenched his hand into a fist on his lips, deliberately suppressing his volume. 

“So, do we open or not?” Ma Hang pursed his lips, and his eyes turned with an unconcealed fear.

The visitor was not good.

Ma Chenggong met Hu Bing’s eyes and shook his head firmly at the same time.

“Bang, bang, bang!!!” The knocking on the door grew louder by the second, rattling the ears. 

Jin Hong frowned and covered her ears in fear.

Xiao Chen was alone in the corner, and when he heard the knocking, he only glanced at the door slightly. After a quick glance at the door, he withdrew his gaze and looked like he was somewhat unconcerned about the matter.

“Bang bang bang!!!” The knocking on the door became more frequent.

“Boom, boom, boom!!!” The next second, the sound turned directly to a heavy object’s sound, hitting the doorway as if it will be broken into. 

Ma Hang’s body shook with fear. He grabbed Ma Chenggong’s arm and clutched his sleeve.

Jin Hong also couldn’t help but stand close to Hu Bing, giving herself a psychological comfort.

Only Huang Ke’s face remained unchanged, with a feeling of being out of the loop.

The sound of knocking and banging on the door lasted for about a minute or two. It might be because the person got tired and actually stopped. 

The sound of footsteps slowly walking away could be heard inside the house.

Hu Bing and Jin Hong looked at each other, and Ma Hang couldn’t help but look at his brother.

Three minutes passed, and it seemed as if everything had returned to normal.

Ma Hang relaxed and said with some fear, “Is he gone?” 

Hu Bing calmly said, “Not sure.”

Ma Hang stood up, intending to look through the glass to see what was going on outside. He was light on his feet and had taken a couple of steps before he looked back. He dared to go and make his way to the window after comforting his heart.

Ma Hang’s heartbeat sped up a bit from nervousness; he placed both his hands against the wall and put his head against the glass to see the scene outside.

It was one of those carved glass windows that had the visual effect of separating the house’s inside. If you don’t put your head against it, you won’t see what’s going on outside. 

“Bang.”

The instant Ma Hang’s eyes pressed against the glass window, someone suddenly scuffled and attached itself to the window with a bang.

Ma Hang’s eyes positioned right up against those eyes! The eyes were bloodshot and were sunken inward. The centers of the eyes were still a little white, and the stare was terrifying.

“Ahhhh!” Ma Hang almost had a heart attack. He was so frightened that he took a step back, his legs weakened, and he dropped directly to his knees. 

Ma Chenggong was quick to see; he immediately stood up and rushed to grab Ma Hang’s hand. He pulled him up and brought him towards his side.

At this instant, the knocking sound outside once again rang out. It was even more violently than before, as if countless hands were banging on the door.

There were many people at the door.

This was the first thought that flashed through everyone’s mind. 

Everyone looked around and stood up. The group grabbed all the defensible things around them and grasped them in their arms.

Jin Hong panicked and picked up the long wooden bench she had just been sitting on. Hu Bing rushed to the corner and picked up the farm hoe that was sitting on the floor.

Huang Ke also pulled out a kitchen knife from somewhere in defense. After Ma Chenggong helped Ma Hang to his feet, he immediately picked up the thick iron stick from the side thrown on the ground at some point. Ma Hang looked around him and grabbed a broom that was not offensive in any way.

Xiao Chen tried to stand up from his stool, but his shoulders were pressed down, so he sat right back. 

Tan Jun put himself in the right position and leaned his head on Xiao Chen’s right shoulder. His appearance carried a bit of dominance that Xiao Chen was all too familiar with.

Xiao Chen lowered his head and locked eyes with him.

At this moment, only he could see Tan Jun’s figure.

Tan Jun smiled and leaned into his ear, with a bit of coaxing in it, and his eyes twinkled, ‘Don’t be afraid, no one would dare to hurt you.’ 

‘Be a good boy and sit here with me, will you?’ There was a bit of a pleading tone in his voice.

Xiao Chen couldn’t stand this tone of his voice the most. With a bit of helplessness, he laughed and directly discarded his armor.

For some reason, it was the same when he was a child.

Obviously, he was much younger than Tan Jun, but Tan Jun was more like a child in front of him and always liked to cling and even be pampered by him. 

“Boom, Boom! Boom, Boom!” There seemed to be some kind of sharp object hitting the entrance door, and each time the door was deformed by a few pounds.

This already dilapidated door couldn’t hold much force against it!

Everyone in the room couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat; almost everyone’s palms were sweaty from excessive stress.

“Boom!” The door was slammed entirely open! 

“Gulp.” The crowd swallowed.

There were at least five old people outside the door!

Each old man had a hideous expression, their mouths cracked open to reveal their yellowed teeth, and their two eyes stared incredibly hard.

Each old man held a kitchen knife that had been sharpened, like a butcher who came to the pigpen to decide whether the pigs should live or die. 

Ma Hang sucked in a breath, and his legs trembled.

The old people looked at each other and laughed heartily as they finally encountered food after being hungry for too long. They grabbed their knives and rushed up, slashing at everyone.

Jin Hong screamed and defended herself with a long wooden bench.

As if Hu Bing had made some mental preparation, he ruthlessly attacked, immediately turning defense into offense. He held the hoe, exposed the sharp part, and rushed forward towards the old man’s head, running in his direction. 

The brains were smashed out, and the old man fell in response.

Hu Bing’s hands were shaking, and he still hadn’t recovered from the emotion of killing.

When he saw Jin Hong’s situation crisis, his eyes widened. He rushed over to help her defend herself with great urgency.

Huang Ke saw the old man rushing in, narrowed his eyes, grabbed another wooden bench next to him, and threw it at the man. He then grabbed a kitchen knife and made the first move, stabbing the old man in the neck without blinking! 

The old man stiffened, the knife in his hand fell off, and blood spurted out directly onto Huang Ke’s face. He remained silent throughout, his face unchanged as if none of this could stir up emotions in him.

In comparison, Ma Chenggong and Ma Hang’s situation was even more critical. Two old men were surrounding and attacking them. Neither of them could turn passive into active at all. As their tools were not sharp, they could only defend passively.

“Brother!” Ma Hang screamed out.

Behind Ma Chenggong, an old man with a knife intended to swing at him. Ma Hang didn’t know what was happening, all the panic turned blank, and like a mad dog, he rushed up without hesitation. He held the broom in his hand and swung it at the old man’s head, but it didn’t do any harm at all. Instead, it angered the man. 

The old man wanted to swing down at Ma Chenggong’s arm, but Ma Hang sucked in a breath and pushed Ma Chenggong away. He received the blow directly with his left hand. Except for his thumb, the other four fingers were all chopped off this instant, and his fingers fell instantly to the ground.

“Ahhhhh,” Ma Hang screamed out. It was so painful that his body began to tremble as blood flowed from his hand.

Ma Chenggong gaped as if he hadn’t recovered from the visual impact of the scene. Fortunately, Huang Ke and Hu Bing immediately reacted and simultaneously killed the two people who attacked Ma Hang and Ma Chenggong.

“Xiao Hang.” Ma Chenggong roared and rushed up to him, his eyes bloodshot. 

Jin Hong immediately headed back to her room to get the medical tools she brought with her.

Xiao Chen opened his mouth, seemingly shaken by the scene in front of him.

Perhaps it was because he had seen several bloody incidents in the village, or maybe it was because he had Tan Jun with him. This time, his reaction wasn’t intense, and he didn’t even feel nauseous.

Tan Jun stared in Ma Chenggong and Ma Hang’s direction and squinted, not knowing what he was remembering. 

In a place where everyone couldn’t notice, Ma Hang’s initial gush of blood was stopped. It may be because he had too much blood on his hands that no one saw it, and the only one who knew medical science, Jin Hong, wasn’t there, so no one knew about it at all.

However, Tan Jun’s approach was keenly noticed by Xiao Chen, sitting next to him. He met his eyes with Tan Jun’s retracted gaze.

Tan Jun saw the question in his mind, touched his hair, and smiled, but did not answer.

He merely saw his and Xiao Chen’s shadow in Ma Hang and Ma Chenggong’s body. 

It was the same.

I’ll also protect you.

“Xiao Hang, I swear! Even if I die, I’ll make sure to get you out of here!” Ma Chenggong’s eyes reddened with anxiety, and he hugged Ma Hang in his arms. Both of them were sitting on the ground as Ma Chenggong reassured Ma Hang.


Ma Hang was trembling all over, and his cold sweat couldn’t stop pouring out, blurring his vision. 

Argh!

It hurts!

Ma Hang’s pale mouth trembled as he let out grunting sounds. He exhaled deeply and buried his head, pleadingly, “It hurts so much!!!! Ah!!!”

Jin Hong was also in a mess because she was too anxious. She ran into the room and pulled open the suitcase. Flipping through it, she threw a bunch of clothes on the floor and hurriedly pulled out the first-aid kit in the innermost compartment. 

Jin Hong’s hands were trembling. As a girl, she had never experienced anything as horrible as today. Still, she had long possessed the quality to stay calm in front of a patient as a medical student.

She forced herself to calm down.

Jin Hong quickly put on the medical gloves, and simply took the four fingers on the ground and handled them with antiseptic gauze. Then, Jin Hong knelt on the floor and prepared to wrap Ma Hang with bandages.

Jin Hong took out the clean dressing and gently pressed Ma Hang’s broken finger; Ma Hang screamed out in pain.

She didn’t have any painkillers in her first aid kit.

“Hold on!” Jin Hong’s voice was also shaking a bit as she tried to calm Ma Hang down.

Ma Hang cried out in pain and grabbed Ma Chenggong’s sleeve with his other hand. He cried out in pain and subconsciously buried his head in his brother’s bosom, muffling his cries. With a devastating emotion, he let out a heart-breaking sound, “Brother!!!! Am I going to die!”

Ma Chenggong’s chest rose and fell, his eyes were red, and even the veins on his temples and scalp were bulging at a visible speed. He gripped Ma Hang’s arms tightly and gritted his teeth. His inner emotions turned in all directions, like a chaotic arrow in his heart, “No, I won’t let you die!” 

How could he not know this pain!!! He had experienced it too! And the person who made him suffer that kind of pain was precisely the person in front of him! The pain was so intense that he wanted to end it right there and then!

Thinking of this, tears gathered in the corners of Ma Chenggong’s eyes at some point.

He really hadn’t expected Ma Hang to stand in his way!

Saying that he came back from his rebirth without complaining at all about what Ma Hang had done in his past life was simply a lie! He was also full of resentment and wanted to question him! 

It was just his senses telling him not to hate this Ma Hang, who had done nothing.

And right now, all of those heated emotions had vanished!

Ma Hang is his brother! You could’ve stood up for your brother even in the face of danger!

Jin Hong tended to the wound, pulled out a dry smile, and comforted, “Don’t worry, you won’t die! You’re lucky, the bleeding stopped!” 

Only after the words were spoken, Ma Chenggong’s tension eased a little, but his entire state was still exhausted.

Hu Bing had been standing at the side with his eyes glued to Jin Hong’s every move. He sighed in relief after hearing the news that Ma Hang was fine.

The anxiety within him multiplied after this incident.

Before he could think of a strategy, he was taken aback by Huang Ke’s actions. 

Huang Ke’s face remained unchanged throughout; there wasn’t even the slightest emotional fluctuation. After Jin Hong made a statement, he turned and looked around, as if he was thinking about something.

Huang Ke paused, his gaze fell on the corpse, and he sucked in a breath as if he was sniffing the thick smell of blood in the air.

He walked straight to the nearest corpse to him, stood next to it, and then squatted down.

Huang Ke didn’t even wear gloves, his hand directly attached to the old man’s face. His clothes were splattered with traces of blood, and his whole body looked very sinister. It seemed that he didn’t think about blood on himself at all, but there was still some disgust in his brow, not even the slightest fear. 

He scrutinized the old man’s face, pulled his mouth down to reveal his teeth. Huang Ke’s mouth suddenly turned up at the corners as if he saw something.

Hu Bing had been standing nearby and observing him; he was sure that Huang Ke was not simple.

“Heh,” Huang Ke let out a sneer. He indifferently withdrew his hand as if he had seen something that satisfied him.

His sneer seemed to contain a thousand emotions, and Hu Bing, who was closest to him, even shivered when he heard the sneer. 

However, Huang Ke’s next move was once again shocked Hu Bing.

Huang Ke leaned down and grabbed both the corpse’s arms, intending to drag it towards the doorway.

Hu Bing was startled and stopped him with his hands.

“What are you doing?” 

Huang Ke swept a cold glance at Hu Bing, “Dragging the man out.”

Hu Bing stared at him with a sharp gaze.

“These corpses are delicious food in the eyes of those people. To leave them here is to lure the wolves in. They won’t be able to resist rushing in, but if we leave them outside the door, it will be to lure the snakes out of their holes, facilitating us to turn passive into being proactive!” Huang Ke’s tone was indifferent, “Not to mention, if we leave these corpses here, the corpses will still have a rotting stench. It’s not safe, and it will cause trouble.”

Hu Bing was silent for a moment and let go of his hand. 

Huang Ke glanced at him, his gaze passed Hu Bing’s direction, and landed on Xiao Chen, who was sitting in the corner, unmoving. Huang Ke was stunned. His eyes instantly turned a bit shaky, as if he didn’t want to be seen the way he was now.

Hu Bing froze in place and stared at Huang Ke’s back in thought.

The old man’s corpse was dragged on the floor, making a ‘crunching’ sound. Huang Ke’s movements looked very skilled; he didn’t even pant as he pulled the corpse that was over a hundred pounds. The whole set of actions flowed smoothly and quickly, dragging one right after the other out, not even shedding a drop of sweat.

Hu Bing moved from his position.

“Thud.” Feet stepped on the ground, making a tiny sound. 

Hu Bing’s figure suddenly shook and froze in place.

His face suddenly turned incomparably ugly.

Hu Bing’s eyes refocused on Huang Ke, and his fingers were trembling a little. He immediately clenched his hand into a fist to suppress his emotions.

What’s going on?! Huang Ke was such a big man, yet he walked on the ground without making any noise? 

Hu Bing’s body trembled a bit, fiercely thinking of the inexplicable male voice from earlier and the strange events in this village.

His heartbeat accelerated.

Was Huang Ke a human?

He let out a deep breath. 

What kind of a village is this? Why are there so many unexplained and odd points?

Villagers! That man! This Huang Ke!

Hu Bing withdrew his gaze and looked in the other direction, his expression grave.

There was also this seemingly harmless Xiao Chen! 

He noticed that when the group of old people rushed in, not one of them even tried to harm Xiao Chen. They even avoided that direction, intentionally or unintentionally! It was like something terrible was standing there.

It’s too strange!

Who the hell is this Xiao Chen? What secrets does he have?

Xiao Chen had initially been staring in Huang Ke’s direction, but suddenly Tan Jun covered his eyes with his hand. He tilted his head and looked at Tan Jun with some confusion. 

Tan Jun lifted his head, with the tip of his tongue pressed against the middle of his teeth, his mouth slightly open, and his nose slightly arched upwards, he didn’t look like he was pleased.

Xiao Chen stared at him, and the corners of his mouth unconsciously turned upward. Still, in order not to be seen by the person next to him acting strangely, he had to restrain himself. He pursed his lips, grasped the pendant with his left hand, narrowed his eyes, and muttered, “Well? Puppy, what do you want?”

Tan Jun pursed his lips, his eyes unmoving as he stared, and locked eyes with Xiao Chen.

The latter was stunned and even looked a little shy and embarrassed by him. Xiao Chen couldn’t help but curse in his heart, ‘Son of a bitch, what are you doing? Don’t look at me like that!’ 

Tan Jun raised his eyebrows and looked even more serious. He deliberately leaned his head closer to the other party and teasingly said, ‘I just want to look at you.’

Before Xiao Chen could answer, Tan Jun suddenly held his head and moved over to seal Xiao Chen’s lips, kissing him directly on the lips, doing it quickly, but gently, with a bit of probing and caution.

The kiss was fleeting. If it weren’t for the fact that Tan Jun had maliciously pushed the tip of his tongue against his teeth when he released his mouth, Xiao Chen would have even wondered if what had just happened was his dream.

Xiao Chen’s body was stiff, and his eyes were unblinking as if he was stupid. It was hard to wait for him to calm down, blinking frantically, feeling like his eyeballs were going to jump out in shock. 

Xiao Chen even forgot to cover up. His voice was particularly small, sounding soft, with a bit of weakness and a kind of unexplainable meaning in it. And even with a bit of thin anger, “What are you doing?”

Tan Jun continued to stare at him, the corners of his mouth unconsciously raised, not feeling embarrassed at all, “Kiss you.”

Xiao Chen choked.

‘Why kiss me.’ Xiao Chen’s words weren’t considered questionable because some answers should actually be evident in his heart. Still, he just didn’t usually think about it, and he even deliberately ignored them subconsciously. 

‘Because I like you.’ Tan Jun raised his eyebrows, eyes narrowed, leaned his mouth to Xiao Chen’s left ear, and uttered the words one by one.

In the whole world, I only like you.

Tan Jun released Xiao Chen, the two of them looked at each other. Tan Jun’s mouth slightly hooked upwards, revealing a curve, the position of his jawbone held up. This smile, in Xiao Chen’s eyes, was damn compelling.

Xiao Chen stared at his face for thirty seconds in silence. Neither of them spoke, and then Xiao Chen blushed rapidly at a visible rate to the naked eye. 

‘You’re shy?’

‘…You shut up.’

Five corpses were neatly thrown in front of the door by Huang Ke.

When Hu Bing thought of Huang Ke’s reaction to observing the old people at that time, he felt strange and secretly thought that something was wrong. He glanced at Huang Ke, who had already entered the house, and walked straight to the door, intending to look at these old people’s corpses. 

These corpses’ faces had turned pale, and their movements had been very stiff, their skin splitting open and blood flying across their flesh.

Hu Bing raised his eyebrows and stared at the corpses with a strong discomfort.

Suddenly, as if he saw something on the corpses’ faces, he immediately leaned down, and his fingers tried to open their teeth.

When he saw the old man’s teeth clearly, Hu Bing’s hand fiercely trembled. 

There were fangs!

What’s going on?

Hu Bing was horrified and hurriedly reached out his hand to check the mouths of every corpse next to him, and the answers were all the same!

Hu Bing’s hands trembled a bit, swallowed his saliva, as if he had suddenly thought of something, and forcefully grabbed the old man’s hand directly. 

When he saw the old man’s hand clearly, his pupils contracted sharply.

The fingernails of these corpses were very black, and there were many grime in the nails’ cracks. The shells were very hard, looking a little strange compared to ordinary people.

Hu Bing felt like there was so much information that his head was going to explode!

They definitely can’t be human! 

Hu Bing was sure.

Fangs…

Are these people vampires?

No, they can’t be! 

Hu Bing forced himself to calm down and took a deep breath.

Vampires only sucked blood and didn’t eat humans at all! So what could this be?

Hu Bing’s eyelids fluttered, and his body was in a stir.

The answer was breathed out. 

Werewolves!

Hu Bing stood up, his legs a little numb and his head a little swollen, and he attached a stiff hand to his temple and rubbed it, his fingers clenching into a fist right after.

Werewolves means curses! They weren’t born as wolves; they were forced to turn into them! Losing your humanity! All that’s left is the violence! Think of people as food! Partying on a full moon night!

Hu Bing let out a deep breath. 

He now needed to make an extremely frightening assumption. He was afraid that all the villagers in this village were werewolves! But if that’s the case, then they’re only in more danger than they thought!

Hu Bing licked his dry lips, frantically calculating the time in his head.

Today was the fourteenth day of the old calendar! The fifteenth of every month was the night of the full moon. Legend had it that once the night of the full moon arrived, the ordinary appearance of werewolves on weekdays would fade away. They would transform into werewolves and start to feed and slaughter, with brutal and bloodthirsty methods.

Hu Bing’s hands began to tremble, his mind was spinning, and he didn’t know how many thoughts had flashed through his mind. 

Just at this moment, Huang Ke walked up to him. Hu Bing didn’t even hear the sound of the movement of Huang Ke walking over. When he turned back, his entire body collided directly with the walking Huang Ke!

Hu Bing was shocked.

Huang Ke remained unfazed, as if he was probing what he had found, the corners of his mouth quirked upwards, and his tone was somewhat flat, “What did you find out?”

Hu Bing’s legs trembled, in his heart, he was more or less afraid of Huang Ke, and his legs unconsciously took a few steps back to the side. 

Huang Ke watched his actions, narrowing his eyes slightly, his expression very dangerous.

Hu Bing laughed out dryly and backed up towards Jin Hong’s group of people, trying to get closer to the center.

Jin Hong had already stood up, and her sharp eyes immediately saw Hu Bing’s slightly anxious and nervous movements. She immediately walked over and asked, “What’s wrong? What did you find?”

Hu Bing glanced at Huang Ke and thought, again and again, knowing that the situation was in crisis and time was not waiting, he had to speak now. Therefore, he exhaled, and his voice sounded a bit drained, “The villagers in this village are most likely all werewolves!” 

“What?” Jin Hong screamed out.

Once again, her three views exploded, and she gritted her teeth in disbelief.

Everything that had happened in the last few days had challenged her worldview too much!

“How can there be werewolves in this world?!” Jin Hong couldn’t help but shake her head. 

Hu Bing helplessly opened his mouth, “We’ve all been through so much, which one of these things can be explained conventionally?”

Jin Hong had nothing to say.

Even Ma Chenggong lifted his head to look at him.

“I just carefully examined their bodies, and every single one of them has fangs and even blackened nails.” Hu Bing paused, his expression struggling a bit, “Vampires only suck blood and don’t eat humans, so I judged that they could only be werewolves.” 

Huang Ke suddenly raised his head and narrowed his eyes. He spoke with a careless tone and expressionlessly uttered a movie line. “Even a pure-hearted person, a person who does not forget to pray at night, will inevitably turn into a wolf on the night of the full moon when the Aconitum is in full bloom.”

Hu Bing, his face a little stiff, glanced at him and continued, “Yes, that’s right, but tomorrow is the fifteenth, the night of the full moon!”

Jin Hong was stunned, and a penetrating chill ran through her heart.

Hu Bing laughed bitterly, with some helplessness, “If we don’t save ourselves, we might actually have to leave our lives here!” 

“Heh.” The Huang Ke beside him suddenly snickered out, and Hu Bing’s body trembled when he heard his laughter.

Jin Hong only felt that Huang Ke’s actions were getting stranger and stranger, but she didn’t think much about it. She wasn’t as observant as Hu Bing.

Huang Ke sneered and looked at the crowd as if hinting at something, “Do you know what werewolves are most afraid of?”

Jin Hong was stunned, then shook her head. 

She didn’t know anything about these gods and monsters or anything like that.

Hu Bing heard the words, but he did not raise his eyebrows, his eyes cleared, and he replied with some excitement, “Is it silver items?!”

Jin Hong looked towards Hu Bing as if waiting for him to explain.

Hu Bing looked up to meet Jin Hong’s eyes and said, “Werewolves are very afraid of silver products. Even just the contact of the surface of their skin can cause them pain!” 

He paused, his brain starting to frantically recall knowledge about werewolves, “Yes, yes!” Hu Bing was somewhat excited. “The heart is the vital part of a werewolf, but the body of a werewolf is like copper and iron. Sticking a silver knife into the heart of a werewolf is the same as sticking a fruit knife into granite or marble. The degree of damage to them is minimal.”

Jin Hong’s heart instantly tensed at the words.

“But,” Hu Bing paused and continued, “the throat is the thinnest and most critical part of a werewolf’s body.”

Hu Bing raised his eyebrows and hooked his lips, “If you can stick a silver knife into a werewolf’s throat, the werewolf will surely die!” 

After Hu Bing’s words, Huang Ke stood aside and let out a sneer, attracting all the attention.

Huang Ke’s head was half bowed, and his bangs half covered his eyes, making it difficult to really see his expression with a bit of shade and secrecy.

“Could it be that you really think that a mere silver product can kill a werewolf?”

It’s time, time to catch them, heh. 



Half of the full moon shines, while the other half is hidden behind the clouds. 

The surroundings were silent and calm, and the sky was a bit dusky, with layers of dark clouds. Except for the moon, there were not even one or two scattered small stars.

Perhaps it was too quiet that one could hear a wind sound blew over from time to time, and even the rustling sound of leaves being shaken could be heard clearly.

Xiao Chen stood at the window, squinting his eyes as if he recalled something.

Tan Jun’s eyes rolled around, and at some point, he stood behind Xiao Chen. When he wasn’t paying attention, he hugged the other’s waist and leaned his head on his left shoulder like a rogue. 

Xiao Chen was shocked, nudged at the other man but failed to push him away. When he saw who it was, his body softened, maintaining an odd pose.

“What’s on your mind?” Tan Jun followed Xiao Chen’s gaze and looked out the window.

Xiao Chen smiled and let out a soft laugh, then reached out and closed the window.

Xiao Chen turned around in Tan Jun’s arms and looked into his eyes.

Tan Jun had a pair of grayish eyes. The candles’ light in the room reflected in his eyes with a flicker, as if they were full of stars.

Xiao Chen paused as if he was nostalgic and softly said, “Do you remember the first time we met?”

Tan Jun raised his eyes and stared at him.

Xiao Chen isn’t a native of Laodu Village. He came here at the age of three with his aunt, who had remarried. 

Tan Jun was nine years old at the time, and although he was young, he had an air of being a lone wolf. He had a cold face, tattered clothes, and didn’t like to talk.

Xiao Chen, who was white and clean, looked even more tender than the little girls in the village. Every move was well-behaved, and he even had a pair of big eyes, which was also very pleasing to others.

However, the village children didn’t know of their xenophobic mentality. Even if Xiao Chen doesn’t provoke them, they like to tease him and force him to cry.

Xiao Chen wasn’t quite able to speak and was overly sensible, so he didn’t say a word every time he was bullied and suffered in silence. 

“Why didn’t you even resist?” The bangs half covered the boy’s eyes, making it difficult to see his appearance.

Xiao Chen rubbed his palms, then blinked and sat on the floor, looking up at the boy who had suddenly spoken to him somewhat helplessly.

“Does it hurt?” The boy looked gloomy and spoke in a hoarse voice.

Xiao Chen shook his head carelessly, then wondered if he was a little aggrieved, curled his lips, and nodded again. 

The boy suddenly laughed out loud; Xiao Chen was surprised and raised his head, pursing his lips as if he was a little dissatisfied.

The boy swept a glance at the kids who just rushed out to push people and ran away from the corner to observe the situation here, and his expression returned to indifference.

He looked at Xiao Chen and walked with a cold face in the direction of the group.

Xiao Chen’s mind flashed with the first meeting’s image and suddenly laughed out loud, reaching out his index finger to scratch at Tan Jun’s nose. 

“Thank you for always protecting me.” Xiao Chen said it word by word with a voice that wasn’t loud, but it was genuine. The corners of his mouth slightly upturned, and the corners of his eyes were also a little moist.

Tan Jun didn’t say anything but simply reached out and ruffled up Xiao Chen’s hair with a smile on his lips.

Xiao Chen curled his mouth, slightly laughing, and sighed, looking at him with incomparably deep eyes and said, “In the future, I’ll protect you, okay?”

There was a moment of silence. 

Someone answered, “Okay.”

You don’t know, from the moment you appeared in my life, I was never able to take my eyes off you. From then on, my world was only you.

—

Hu Bing handed the silver knives to each of them personally, and in the process, he locked eyes with Huang Ke, who looked over at him several times. Hu Bing’s teeth clenched as he tried to pretend he hadn’t seen his probing gaze, maintaining the appearance that he was unaware of what was going on. 

Ma Chenggong nodded when he received the knife. He had dark circles under his eyes, and one could tell he hadn’t rested too well.

Ma Hang stayed in his room because he was injured, and they didn’t let him out.

After distributing the knives, Hu Bing was ready to knock on Xiao Chen’s door. After Zhang Xiaoxian’s death, Jin Hong had been separated from Xiao Chen’s room.

Huang Ke, who had been silent for a long time, seemed to have read Hu Bing’s intentions and suddenly stood up, stopping Hu Bing’s way. In a split second, Hu Bing’s face turned ugly. 

Huang Ke spoke concisely, “Give me the knife. I’ll do it.”

Hu Bing pursed his lips as if he had a long mental struggle and finally placed the silver knife he had prepared for Xiao Chen in the other’s hand.

Huang Ke’s attitude towards Xiao Chen was also strange.

Hu Bing was keenly aware of this. 

The silver knives Hu Bing had prepared were all found in the storage room on the second floor. It was after he guessed that the villagers might be werewolves that he began to realize that there were no silver products in the entire house at all.

Thinking of this, Hu Bing’s hand holding the knives paused.

These items had appeared so timely that they instead made him feel unreal, like someone was calculating something in the dark.

Hu Bing stared at Huang Ke’s back, not knowing why he suddenly felt a little flustered. 

But now, Hu Bing didn’t have time to overthink!

Because it’s getting late at night!

If his suspicions held true, these villagers would be transformed into werewolves tonight! And every single one of them here is meat to the werewolves!

Thinking of this, Hu Bing pulled out the lighter he had prepared from his pocket and pursed his lips. 

Werewolves are afraid of silver products, and they are also scared of fire.

‘A fire to burn this place down.’ Hu Bing’s mind couldn’t help but be reminded of that low and cold voice.

And that mysterious man.

Hu Bing’s eyes were dark, not knowing what he was pondering. Hu Bing vaguely felt that he wasn’t far from the so-called truth. 

This step might mean death, but to succeed was to be desperate.

Huang Ke paused outside the door of Xiao Chen’s room, wondering if he was under some kind of oppression. The cold sweat on his forehead was tearing down hard, and the closer he got to the door, the more oppressive the pressure was. While his expression became increasingly grim, it seemed as if he would kneel in the next second due to his legs’ weakness.

Eventually, Huang Ke kneeled straight down with a thud, along with the knife he was trying to give to Xiao Chen, which also fell off his hand in response.

‘Don’t think about things that don’t belong to you.’ Someone’s voice pierced through his eardrums and poured directly into his heart! 

The voice was angry, even murderous, and the words were powerfully possessive.

Huang Ke’s mind was shaken, something was pulled out of his head, and his expression changed from distorted to dull, even lifeless.

The man was like a puppet with a broken string, losing his life and only being manipulated like a machine. Huang Ke stood up with a blank expression, turned around, and finally left.

Heh. 

Someone let out a sneer.

Even if you have such memories, it’s not something you experienced personally.

He! Is mine!

“Wooo!” A sudden, long howl cut through the sky, the sound dragging on for a long time, startling the otherwise drowsy crowd to their feet with a sudden jolt. 

This cry was very sharp, even piercing, and one could hear the source of the sound a distance away.

The cry, which was too disproportionate to the silent night, finally stopped. However, before the crowd could breathe a sigh of relief, the tiger's body shook the next instant.

“Ang–”

“Woo-” 

“Ow–”

The moment the first howl ceased as if in response to it, one cry after another of varying lengths suddenly rang out. The howls carrying a burst of echoes in the silent night came from all directions, boiling like a carnival.

The moon was full! The entire silhouette was exposed from behind the clouds! The dead leaves on the big trees’ tops seemed to be sprinkled with silver powder, shearing out light and shadow.

“Thud-” 

“Da-da-da-”

Strange sounds came from outside the house, one after another.

Ma Chenggong’s hands were all sweaty.

He thought that he had lived a new life and knew the whole truth about this village, that the person who cursed this village and killed him was Tan Jun. But the funny thing was that he didn’t know anything else but that. What he was experiencing now was a huge deviation from his memory. 

Could it be that after he died, these things happened to the rest of the group? Did they learn that all villagers are actually werewolves?

In the end, he turned out to know nothing.

That’s ridiculous!

“Boom, boom, boom!!!” Someone was pounding on the door. 

The people were on edge and took their weapons.

“Squeak-” As if some sharp object was scraping the glass and the walls, making an unpleasant, ear-splitting sound.

“What do we do?” Jin Hong asked out in panic, and one could tell that she was desperately trying to control herself not to be afraid. Still, at this moment, when her life was at stake, she simply couldn’t handle the emotions causing her to break down.

But, before anyone could answer, 

“Boom!” Once again, the door was knocked directly open, but the door panel flew straight to the ground, unlike the last time.

The hairy creature, with its ghostly green eyes, stood in the doorway. It was huge, with very rugged and muscular arms! It is both human-sized and a wild animal, with a wolf’s head!

Werewolves!

Everybody choked! 

The werewolf moved its neck, its bones cracking, and its muzzle parted, its ghostly eyes staring at everyone in the room.

Hehe, it’s food.

Tan Jun held Xiao Chen in his arms, his eyes were deep, and his gaze contained many emotions. Finally, he gently drew a cross symbol with his index finger on Xiao Chen’s head.

The originally drowsy Xiao Chen blinked his eyes in confusion and tilted his head, looking at him with some doubts. 

Tan Jun laughed and leaned into his ear, “Remember, don’t be afraid! No matter what happens next! You just have to remember! Me! I will definitely come back to you!”

And the only thing I ask of you is that you be able to protect yourself.



“Ahhhhh!!!” Jin Hong was so frightened that she took a step back directly, her entire body ducked behind Hu Bing. Hu Bing’s heart rate also increased; he gritted his teeth, locking eyes with Ma Chenggong beside him. 

The werewolf’s nose moved slightly, its green eyes turned, cold and fierce as if it had smelled something delicious in the room, its mouth moved slightly, revealing its fangs.

Ma Chenggong did not want to take the initiative to confront the werewolf. He held a silver knife in his hand, his face was grave, and his eyes were dark.

He had died once, and he had nothing to fear; his only thought now was to let Ma Hang leave this place alive.

Thinking of this, Ma Chenggong once again tightened the weapon in his hand. 

The werewolf’s ghostly eyes narrowed, the orbs of its eyes turned into strips in an instant, as if suddenly sharpened by some stimulus. It then stretched back on its right leg, cracked its mouth, and jumped up, aiming directly in the crowd’s direction.

“Ahhhh!” Jin Hong screamed out in fear and ran to the side.

It jumped very far! With a light bounce, it can already jump several meters!

Everyone reacted quickly enough to sidestep the werewolf the moment it jumped!

But the werewolf didn’t give up the attack and instead got pissed off. It was like an eagle catching a chicken, with a bit of banter, even playing with its prey.

“Ah!” Jin Hong was just a few centimeters away from being grabbed by the werewolf. She once again screamed out in fear. Hu Bing quickly pulled the person into his arms.

The werewolf threw its head back, its hairy face slightly twitching, it opened its mouth wide. Perhaps it was the scream Jinhong had just made that angered it, but it tilted its head up and let out a long, miserable howl.

“Howl-” 

It was a loud and penetrating sound, and for a moment, as it tilted its head up, the crowd shuddered.

Jin Hong’s legs were a little weak, and the tears had been utterly frightened out of her eyes. The longer the werewolf’s voice dragged on, the weaker her legs became.

“Woaoh-” another howl appeared behind the crowd.

Hu Bing and Ma Chenggong’s faces turned white at the same time. 

A new werewolf had appeared in the doorway out of nowhere when everyone wasn’t paying attention. It looked half a head shorter than the werewolf in the house but otherwise seemed to be identical. Its eyes glowed a ghostly green; its tongue licked its fangs, and there were traces of blood on its mouth.

Hu Bing’s brain felt like it was empty, and he swallowed his saliva.

This werewolf had eaten the corpse outside the door!

The crowd’s heartbeats seemed to slam to a halt for a moment, frozen in place, but before they could think of a response, the scene in front of them instantly stunned the crowd. 

“Ow-”

“Howl-”

These two werewolves didn’t have the feeling of sympathizing with each other when they met their own kind. Instead, they howled at each other from the moment they saw each other, showing ruthless expressions.

The smaller werewolf glared with wide eyes, its pupils contracted and became strips, its feet moved two steps closer to Ma Chenggong. It was this action that instantly angered the werewolf inside the house. It grinned and rushed up without saying anything, showing its sharp claws, poking and scraping the other werewolf. 

But they were of the same clan and knew each other like the back of their hand. The moment it was attacked, the smaller one immediately bounced off with the wall behind it and mercilessly scraped at the big wolf’s face.

“Howl!!!” The larger wolf was obviously thoroughly enraged, and the two instantly began tearing at each other in chaos.

A wolf, dedicated and greedy, trampling on its domain for food was the original sin!

Even the same kind will not be tolerated! 

Hu Bing and Ma Chenggong looked at each other and immediately grabbed Jin Hong’s arm and retreated backward.

Huang Ke was silent from beginning to end, not even showing any outward emotion, just like a lifeless puppet with strings.

The two werewolves poured out all their strength, beating and biting each other mercilessly…

Finally, its strength was almost exhausted after several rounds of fighting. The other werewolf saw the opportunity. With a sharp look in its eyes, it plunged its claws and teeth directly into its heart. 

The smaller wolf’s body shook as if it realized something and started to retreat, but it was too late. It not only didn’t protect its heart but even exposed its fragile neck as it dodged.

In the blink of an eye, flesh and blood flew everywhere. The werewolf screamed at the top of its lungs as if it had poured out all its strength. Its voice was horrifying and even penetrating.

The bigger werewolf didn’t let it go because it was out of breath but instead sat down on the ground, grabbed the other’s flesh, and started to gnaw on it.

When Hu Bing saw this heart-stopping scene, his eyebrows suddenly jumped. Not knowing what came to mind, he instantly spoke out in fear, “No, we have to go! Its screams and the smell of blood will attract more werewolves.” 

Jin Hong’s legs went weak, her heart palpitating, her bones chilling, and she said in despair, “Go? Where can we go?”

Before Hu Bing could reply, outside the door, a long howling wolf cry erupted instantly. It sounded increasingly louder and closer, coming from all directions as if the next second, some werewolves would burst out and barge through the door!

As soon as Xiao Chen opened the door to his room, this was what he saw, his eyelids jumped, and he frowned. He quickly realized that the room seemed to have been set up with a layer of something similar to a boundary. In his room, he couldn’t hear any movement outside, and as soon as he stepped out of the door, the spiky howl of a wolf instantly hit his ears.

Hu Bing’s group had been forced back to the corner and were directly face to face with Xiao Chen. 

Hu Bing was planning to hide in Xiao Chen’s room, but he had only just taken his first step when he was directly sidestepped by the red-eyed Ma Chenggong, “No! We have to take Xiao Hang with us!”

Ma Hang’s room was connected to Xiao Chen’s room.

Hu Bing raised his eyebrows. No time was given for him to think; he could only nod, “Alright then, let’s get over there!”

Xiao Chen covered his mouth and nose with his turtleneck sweater, both hands in his pockets, as always, he was silent. 

Huang Ke’s expressionless face cracked when Xiao Chen appeared. His eyes were unblinkingly staring at Xiao Chen’s figure, even walking directly behind him and continuing to stare at him.

As soon as Xiao Chen saw Huang Ke, he thought of Tan Jun’s death, his hands clenched in fists, and in his eyes was an unconcealed disgust.

For some reason, the werewolf that was happily eating made a sudden pause, dropping the stump in its hands. Its nose moved as if it had smelled a food that made it irresistible, and it scampered and stood up from the ground, its neck moving, making a bone-crushing sound.

Xiao Chen somehow received the werewolf’s signal almost the instant the werewolf stood up. He even saw right away that the werewolf’s target was himself! 

The werewolf glanced at the crowd, but this time, it didn’t take direct action like it did the first time. Instead, it had a few hesitations like it had some scruples, its feet were turning in place, and its expression was shaking a little, but it never moved forward.

But in the next second, its look became ruthless, as if the thing that threatened it had disappeared. With its innate wolf nature, it began to spread its teeth and claws, its eyes emitting a ghostly green light. With its claws that were still full of blood, it intended to move forward to attack.

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows jumped. He directly turned sideways, running in the side direction, while Hu Bing, Jin Hong, and Ma Chenggong ran towards Ma Hang’s room.

Huang Ke’s eyes narrowed. The original empty gaze slowly regained its godliness, and even the color of his eyes gradually became lighter. His look was sharp, almost without hesitation, he directly embraced Xiao Chen in his arms, then grabbed his hand and began to run to the side. 

Xiao Chen was shocked and tried to shake off Huang Ke’s hand, but he was grabbed even tighter by the other party. The danger was imminent; Xiao Chen had no time to think about anything else, so he could only let the other party grab his hand.

The werewolf showed his claws as if he considered Xiao Chen as his food; each strike carried a merciless aggressiveness. It was probably because fighting with the smaller wolf made him lose heart to tease his prey so that at this moment, he only wanted to hunt his prey quickly. Thus, it followed Xiao Chen’s pace closely, waiting for the opportunity to strike.

But Huang Ke’s speed was fast, not even losing to the werewolf, he grabbed Xiao Chen’s hand and brought him to dodge quickly. Once the werewolf attacked, he reacted fast in a short amount of time, even avoiding every move with accuracy.

And Hu Bing’s group was able to move a lot more conveniently because Xiao Chen had become the werewolf’s target. Still, at this critical moment, they no longer had more time to take care of Xiao Chen and Huang Ke. 

The only thing on Ma Chenggong’s mind was Ma Hang, and as soon as he saw an opportunity, he had already rushed straight to Ma Hang’s room to check on his brother’s condition.

Hu Bing and Jin Hong hesitated and looked at Xiao Chen’s situation, but they also followed into the room.

The werewolf became increasingly fast and even more oppressive.

Huang Ke’s eyes were dark and fierce, and he pushed Xiao Chen directly behind him, then glared at the werewolf’s green eyes and hissed out, “Get out!!!” 

The werewolf didn’t know what kind of stimulus it had received. Its expression trembled, and the pace of its attack stopped for an instant. It then retreated two steps, gasping for breath, and turned straight around without a word, intending to run away.

Huang Ke took the silver knife he was carrying out of its scabbard. He aimed at the werewolf with a sharp gaze, as if calculating something, and shot it over with the knife. It was unknown what kind of strength Huang Ke had. Still, he accurately stabbed directly into the werewolf’s heart and even pierced its chest.

The werewolf was in a state of shock, and its eyes were wide open. Its legs went limp, and a loud sound was heard. Without even closing its eyes, the whole body fell directly to the ground, blood flowing out from its position.



Xiao Chen opened his mouth slightly and then looked at Huang Ke’s back in horror. Huang Ke dropped the knife sheath on the ground and walked to the werewolf’s body as if he was examining whether it was dead or not. His bangs were blocking half of his face, making it hard to see his expression. 

Huang Ke stretched out his hand and pulled out the knife from the werewolf’s heart, then wiped the blade on the werewolf’s fur and stood up as if nothing had happened.

Huang Ke turned his head, and his gaze rested on Xiao Chen accurately. His original indifferent expression returned, and the corner of his mouth moved as if he was smiling.

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows relaxed, and his hand on the wall loosened. He stared at Huang Ke and hesitated. He felt that this expression of Huang Ke’s was familiar to him; even the curve of his mouth and his muscles’ change were very familiar to him.

As he thought of this, his expression changed, and a thought slowly came out in Xiao Chen’s heart. 

But before Xiao Chen could figure it out, the wolf cries outside the door grew louder and louder. One werewolf figure after another appeared in the doorway, but they seemed to be afraid of something and did not dare to come in.

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows jumped; he was stunned.

Huang Ke’s eyes narrowed, and he rushed up with a single step to directly protect the stunned Xiao Chen in his arms.

Green lights appeared outside the window, then the front door.

One pair, two pairs, three pairs…

More and more!!!

Xiao Chen held his breath.

Huang Ke’s expression didn’t change. He had a silver knife in his hand. His face was fierce as he swept over the sudden green light spots. He didn’t have any fear. He looked at the window and the door and then hooked the corner of his mouth. 

Hu Bing opened the door as if to make sure that the Xiao Chen duo was safe. He had only just sneaked a couple of glances before he was startled by the dense green light. The door directly made a small sound from his reaction.

Huang Ke’s gaze turned back as he heard the sound, and his gaze fell through the door onto Hu Bing, who shivered at Huang Ke’s stare.

Huang Ke gripped Xiao Chen’s hand tightly and moved in Hu Bing’s direction. Still, his strength was very subtle, grabbing Xiao Chen’s hand without causing him pain.

When Hu Bing saw this, he immediately opened the door. 

However, Huang Ke had no intention of going in. He looked at Hu Bing with a cold face and opened his mouth, “Fire.”

“What?” Hu Bing was shocked.

“The lighter in your pocket.” Huang Ke swept a glance at his pocket; his tone was cold.

Hu Bing stared at Huang Ke in disbelief. He hid his lighter so well that he had not been able to take it out at all. He didn’t know how the other man knew he had brought it with him. 

Huang Ke’s face was still the same, but the temperament seemed to have changed drastically, even with a murderous sense.

Hu Bing trembled with his hands and fidgeted as he pulled out the lighter, then handed it to Huang Ke.

Huang Ke took the lighter, and then his eyes fell back to Xiao Chen. He didn’t say anything, just narrowed his eyes. The expression in his eyes was so complicated that Xiao Chen could not understand it.

However, Huang Ke directly pressed down on Xiao Chen’s shoulders, pushing him into Ma Hang’s room, his mouth slightly hooked up with a smile. 

Xiao Chen panicked and seemed to want to say something, but Huang Ke stopped him in time. He looked back at Hu Bing with a cold face and instructed, “Take care of him.”

He was referring to Xiao Chen.

Hu Bing was even more shocked, and his pupils contracted.

This sentence, this tone of voice, was incomparably familiar to him! 

As if Xiao Chen realized something, he tried to grab Huang Ke’s hand, but Huang Ke smiled and avoided Xiao Chen’s touch, his grey eyes flashing.

He turned around straight away.

Xiao Chen was utterly frozen in place. He wasn’t sure if Hu Bing had seen it, but he clearly saw that from the moment Huang Ke stepped forward, their room was sprinkled with a transparent shielding film, separating them from the outside.

Hu Bing took a glance at Huang Ke and then at Xiao Chen. As if he realized something, he immediately pulled Xiao Chen into the room. 

Huang Ke threw the silver knife directly on the ground and shook his head.

The werewolves outside the door still seemed to be afraid of something and hadn’t come in. But the green light was becoming increasingly dense, revealing a chill.

“Heh,” Huang Ke sneered out, narrowed his eyes, and took off the outer coat he was wearing. He curled his lips, lit the lighter, and pointed the hem of the coat at the flame source.

The fire burned fast like gasoline had been thrown on it, the clothes quickly burned up! 

Huang Ke stepped unhurriedly, his feet making subtle sounds on the floor. He slowly moved towards the front door, his eyes like a stagnant water puddle, somewhat mysterious.

And the green light was growing more like there were more and more things coming this way.

Huang Ke sneered.

Today is the day! 

Go to hell!

A swift fire!

Very destructive!

Not just the houses, but even the woods, the whole village was surrounded by fire! It spread extremely fast! It was like they’ve been planning this for a long time, and it only took half an hour to set the whole place on fire! 

The wind was blowing and making whistling noises, slowly driving the fire bigger…

“What’s going on? Why isn’t the fire coming into our room?” Jin Hong covered her mouth and nose. She was so agitated that she was about to lose her voice, and her voice was a little hoarse.

Who the hell was Huang Ke?

It was a question that circled around everyone’s heart. 

Ma Chenggong sat next to Ma Hang and pressed down on his shoulders, reassuring his brother. He looked out the window at the swift fire, not knowing what to think about, but Ma Hang clearly felt his brother’s arms and legs stiffen a bit.

It was so strange!

It doesn’t make any sense!

Ma Chenggong had no idea why there was such a big contrast between this world and the world before his rebirth. 

In the last world, did those people eventually survive?

But it didn’t matter anymore because he knew that he could live now!

Ma Chenggong pursed his lips and gripped Ma Hang’s hand.

He would take his brother and live! 

Xiao Chen’s collar covered half of his face, making it impossible to see too much of his expression. His eyes were downcast, his eyebrows covered by his bangs, and he stood in the doorway without saying a word. His left hand was gripping the pendant around his neck, maintaining a rigid posture as he stood in place.

‘Tan Jun?!’ Xiao Chen anxiously cried out in his heart, trying to soothe the terrible thoughts within him.

‘Tan Jun! Are you there? Answer me now!” Xiao Chen’s hands were clenched, and his lips were trembling as if his entire body was immersed in his own world.

But no matter how many times Xiao Chen called in his heart, Tan Jun, who had never been more than a meter away from him in the past few days, did not respond from beginning to end. 

Silence.

Xiao Chen collapsed as his legs went limp. He was directly paralyzed on the ground, his right hand inserted into his pocket, grasping another broken bone.

That person just now! Was it Tan Jun?

Xiao Chen already had a definite answer inside him, but he didn’t dare to think about it or admit it. He could only keep comforting himself in his head over and over again that it couldn’t be true. 

“We will live, right?” Ma Hang was a little speechless, the corners of his eyes were filled with tears, his face was even more incomparably haggard. His current appearance was completely different from that first day’s young master’s look as if he had been forced to grow up and become more mature.

When Ma Chenggong heard Ma Hang make a sound, he returned to his senses, forced a smile, and tugged at the corners of his mouth. He patted Ma Hang’s shoulder, stared into his eyes, and thoughtfully replied, “Yes! I swear!”

Jin Hong was already sobbing on the side like she finally had a chance to let out her emotions without having to hold herself back and panic in her heart.

Hu Bing remained silent from start to finish, his eyes somewhat vacant as he stared at the blazing fire burning outside the window. Not to mention the fire, not even the smell of smoke spread inside the room. 

He froze and raised his right hand blankly, unsure of what he was thinking about.

This Huang Ke, was he the man who saved him that time?

That tone! That tone! It’s so similar!

Hu Bing spat out a breath, his body a little stiff. 

Did he save us all?

No, that wasn’t right.

As if Hu Bing suddenly realized something, his eyes were placed back on Xiao Chen.

No!!! The only person that man wanted to save was just Xiao Chen! 

It was as if he had a million questions that he wanted Xiao Chen to answer. Still, he just stared in Xiao Chen’s direction for several more minutes. Finally, without opening his mouth, he withdrew his gaze.

Because the answers, at this moment, were no longer that important.

The wind outside kept blowing, making a rustling sound.

Sparks splattered, flew up, and fell back to the ground. 

Time flowed minute by minute, and the sky also slowly broke an opening from the night and turned bright.

Jin Hong shuddered and pushed open the door.

It was deserted.

Blackened remnants of trees and blackened land. 

“I, have we survived?” Jin Hong was a bit in disbelief and somewhat excited as she rushed over and hugged Hu Bing.

The latter was stunned, tears welling up in the corners of his eyes, “Mm.”

Ma Hang was excited and hugged his brother, the injured hand trembling slightly.

Ma Chenggong choked at the scene in front of him as if there was still a sense of unreality. 

We’re actually still alive!

And this time, there were no woods to obstruct them, nor was there a white mist. They didn’t even have to go very far before they directly reached the village entrance.

On the way out of the mountain village, Xiao Chen was like an emotionless creature with a numb face. He clutched the necklace around his neck from start to finish, not knowing what he was thinking.

When the group had walked ten miles and finally hitchhiked with pedestrians, Jin Hong seemed to remember something. She touched the tears of excitement in the corners of her eyes and asked Hu Bing, “Right, I never asked you how you know so many things ah, what do you do?” 

Hu Bing paused and shyly lowered his head. He touched the back of his neck and said with a bit of a dry smile, “I, I’m actually a detective-type horror streamer at home.”

Jin Hong nodded, “Then, why did you come back?”

Hu Bing scratched his cheeks, pulled out the handwritten letter from his trouser pocket, and said, “This letter says there is a lot of material here that I can write about.”

When Jin Hong choked and wanted to laugh a little, Hu Bing asked her back, “Why did you come?” 

Jin Hong sighed and said with some embarrassment, “I’m short of money lately, and the letter said that there are mines here…”

Xiao Chen stared out at the sun in the sky.

“Remember, don’t be afraid! No matter what happens next! You just have to remember! Me! I will definitely come back to you!”

Xiao Chen tightened his hand around the pendant. 

Tan Jun, I’ll be waiting for you to come back!



“Eh eh eh.” The man was shocked by the sudden appearance of a person on the side of the road. His throat could not help but tighten, and then frantically pressed the horn on the motorcycle, both feet on the ground, emergency braking. 

After the bike came to a stop, the man was filled with anger and cursed at the man, “Are you sick? Look at the road!”

Xiao Chen paused and did not react to the man’s cursing words, as if it didn’t matter what he did. While his cheeks looked even more hollow than before, and his entire body had little flesh and much less spirit, he still preferred to block his jaw with a turtleneck sweater.

“Pay more attention next time!!!” The man yelled out.

The man was in a hurry to go to work, so he didn’t bother to argue with Xiao, but he was too angry, so he just whispered a few curses and drove away shakily. 

Xiao Chen was a little distracted and watched the man’s distant back without paying too much attention to him. He stood dumbly in the same place for a few minutes before he woke up like a dream, looked around, and then continued to walk forward.

“Boss, give me a bunch of green gypsophila.” The girl had a glance at the flowers in the flower shop and called out to Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen nodded numbly and stood up from his position, then took out the wrapping paper from the cabinet next to him. He walked over to the girl and wrapped it for her.

The girl paused and frowned, “No, I want the green ones, not the purple ones!”

With a pause, Xiao Chen dropped his eyes and picked up the green gypsophila on the side again to wrap it for her.

It was clear that this was not the first time the girl has come to this shop. She looked at Xiao Chen’s state and then around inside the flower shop. She couldn’t help but mutter, “Boss, what’s wrong with you lately? I saw the shop had been closed for a long time, but now that it’s reopened again, how come there are still several pots of rotten flowers in the shop that you forgot to throw away.”

Xiao Chen was stunned and followed her gaze to a pile of wilted roses placed by the wall corner.

Not one or two, but there are countless of them all piled up in the corner. There were no other varieties of rotten flowers, only red roses. Looking over, it seems like it was deliberately put there, and there is a kind of visual effect. 

Xiao Chen looked at this pile of flowers and lowered his head. It was unknown whether it was self-consolation or what, he sighed and said somewhat absent-mindedly, “Oh, I forgot.”

The girl didn’t think much of it, took her flowers, and hurriedly paid for them. Out of the goodness of her heart, she instructed him a couple of times before leaving with the flowers in her arms.

She had just walked out of the door, but for some reason, as if with a feeling, she suddenly turned back and looked through the glass at the shop.

From where she looked, the young owner was still standing motionless, his eyes resting on the pile of defeated roses, wondering what he was missing. In contrast, the owner, who didn’t like to show his face, pulled off the collar that covered his face, picked something out from inside the collar, held it in his hand, and then smiled. 

That smile was a beautiful one.

The thought popped into the girl’s head, and she couldn’t help but whisper it in her mind.

She had been to this shop a few times. The name was strange; it was called Spanish Castle. She spoke good English, and she knew that the name translates to Garden in the Sky.

It was like a sustenance for the soul, a sky garden that encapsulated all of that person’s dreams. 

But what did that have to do with her? She scoffed and shook her head, intending to walk forward.

Just as she came back to her senses, her eyes were instantly drawn to another boy on the street.

This boy didn’t look big, but his temperament was unique, mature, and even a little gloomy. He wore a long green trench coat and had bangs that half covered his eyes. His eyes were striking, they looked a little lighter in color and had an unmistakable charm, but he looked a little strange and cold.

The girl stood there, holding the flowers, and met his gaze, and her heart skipped a beat. 

The boy glanced at her, at the flowers she was holding in her hand, and finally, he withdrew his gaze and looked towards the flower shop.

“Spanish Castle,” The girl heard the boy pronounce the name softly upon seeing the flower shop, with a tone that was both tender and spoiling, and suddenly, he let out a soft laugh.

The girl opened her mouth, feeling a little confused, and she watched as the boy tugged on his collar and walked towards the flower shop.

“Dingling” It was the sound of the wind chimes shaking as the door opened. 

Xiao Chen had his back to the door and reacted at once when he heard the sound, saying smoothly, “Welcome.”

When he turned around and saw the appearance of the visitor, his entire body froze in place.

The boy stood in the doorway against the light, with a smile on his lips, looking at his beloved. He stepped lightly in the other party’s disbelieving gaze. He walked to the other party’s front, attached his palm to his face, and hooked his lips, “I’m back.

Xiao Chen’s hands were a little shaky, and he was a little out of breath. His eyes were staring, and his feet paused in place. As if he was afraid it was a phantom, he didn’t dare to reach out his hand, “You…” 

The boy was half a head taller than Xiao Chen and was like a little child who wanted candy. He put his head on Xiao Chen’s left shoulder and kept rubbing against it, saying somewhat playfully, “I missed you so much.”

Xiao Chen clenched his palms as if he had finally accepted the reality and stretched out his hands to hug the boy’s waist. His tone carrying a few unspoken meanings of aggravation and pettiness, “Why did you just come back?”

The boy laughed, hugging Xiao Chen tighter and touching the other’s hair with a thousand unspoken emotions.

“I’m back, and I won’t leave again.” 

Xiao Chen nodded his head as he choked a bit.

Tan Jun looked at Xiao Chen’s face, somewhat distressed. He slowly pulled the turtleneck sweater off the other party’s face and attached his palm directly to the other party’s jaw, caressing it carefully, “You’ve lost weight again.”

Huang Ke has initially been a dead baby, born from relying on his flesh and blood! There was a magical bond between them!

And Huang Ke was given his mission from birth – to find Xiao Chen. 

And how exactly did the man who killed him with his own hands die?

He was killed by the living Huang Ke.

So Huang Ke was not a human from the beginning; he can only be considered a body, a puppet with a mind. Those letters were ordinary invitations written by the village chief to change the village’s status quo by experimenting with those living people who left the village.

But how can you find those people who have been gone for more than a decade? All of this was also the push he did, just in case, he amplified the points of greed and fear that enticed everyone to come through here. 

There was no other reason; it was that he needed to leave here. He would have to destroy this village if he wanted to leave, but he needed someone to stall for him. All of this had to be based on the premise that Xiao Chen was safe and sound. So, he needed to use someone else’s hand, someone who could protect Xiao Chen, someone who could be Xiao Chen’s target, to keep Xiao Chen safe and sound.

And Huang Ke’s body would also be sacrificed to him on the night of the full moon.

Thinking of this, Tan Jun’s gaze withdrew and landed on Xiao Chen’s body, as if he was chasing his light, and his eyes seemed to contain stars. He smiled and hugged Xiao Chen even tighter.

Because only this way, he could stay by Xiao Chen’s side as a person. 

Xiao Chen choked a little, and with a low voice, he said, “Tan Jun, we’ll be together for a long time.”

—

“Eh, boss, you’re looking good today!” The girl once again patronized Spanish Castle after half a month.

Today’s Xiao Chen was very different from the previous Xiao Chen. He no longer covered his face with a turtleneck sweater. He was showing his face generously, and even the color of gloom was no longer between his eyebrows. Instead, there was a kind of unexplainable charm in it. 

The girl looked around the place; the interior of the shop had also made a big change. The previous flower shop was simple and even had a few retro vibes.

But today, even the wallpaper on the wall had been replaced with a pair of cartoon paintings.

A cute rainbow snake with an adorable smile and a small rose with a proud face.

There was a bit of playfulness. 

The girl looked at the drawing and suddenly laughed out loud.

“Hmm-” the girl thought deeply for two seconds, “Give me a pot of bluebells today.”

Bluebells, tender love.

Xiao Chen nodded and headed inside to carry the flower pot. 

“Ding bell.” The chimes hanging from the front door rang once more, and the door was pushed open.

The girl turned back at the sound of the bell, and when she saw the face of the person coming, she was slightly surprised.

It was the man from that day.

Tan Jun was wearing a rather Japanese-style dark green sweater and a beret, and even if he was standing there, he was a sight to behold. 

He was carrying two pots of food in a thermos in his hands, and he swept a glance at the female as he entered.

With a familiar approach, he placed his things on the counter. Then, tied on another apron hanging next to the counter. He simply tied a knot, but it was an ugly knot. As a girl with OCD, the sight of it made her want to help him retie it.

Xiao Chen walked out from the back room just then, and Tan Jun turned back at the sound of his voice. He locked eyes with him, his lips smiling and unable to stop rising.

Xiao Chen smiled at him, holding the bluebells and placing them on the counter. His eyes pointed and narrowed, noticing the apron knot Tan Jun tied. He scowled, saying with some helplessness, “How many times have I taught you? Why are you still doing it like this.” 

It sounded like a reproach in words, but it sounded like spoiling.

The girl had some toothache when she saw this.

I’m going to die of sourness.

Xiao Chen touched Tan Jun’s hair, which was sticking out of his hat. He propped up his feet again and patted the man’s hair. 

After Xiao Chen finished coaxing the man, he finally realized that there was someone next to him. He smiled at the girl and handed the flower pot to her, his eyes narrowed into a line, “Welcome to come again next time.”

The girl stared at Xiao Chen’s face for two seconds and then looked at the man who had been staring intently at the boss since the moment the boss appeared, and couldn’t help but puff out a laugh.

When Xiao Chen saw her expression, he blinked in confusion. In the next second, he unconsciously locked eyes with Tan Jun, who was behind him, as if he was asking if he knew the answer.

The girl smiled and waved her hand, “It’s alright, it’s alright!” 

She just saw what love looked like.

What does love look like?

It is just when two people who love each other they simply stay together. Even if you see each other’s face, the corners of your mouth will not be able to stop rising. As soon as I see you, I want to laugh, and when you come, the sky will be clear. 

I love you, that’s all. 




Arc 3, Devil Exchange



“Congratulations to the Wish Player for activating The Devil’s Game. You may now speak your wish to the Devil. Of course, you will need to trade the most important thing in your life in exchange for that. 

So, are you ready to make an exchange with the Devil?”

“Ring, ring,” the noisy alarm clock chimed noisily.

The person under the blanket moved, his head still tucked under the blanket, faintly making a vague outline on the sheet. The person inside was like a caterpillar squirming from side to side, with only half of his hair was exposed.

Probably annoyed by the ringing, the man swayed back and forth inside the blanket with increasing amplitude. 

Finally, he slowly peeked out a pair of sleepy eyes before slowly arching his head out, revealing a white, pale face.

The boy had black marks under his eyes, and it was evident that he had not rested well. Nevertheless, it was difficult to conceal his pristine face, especially his eyes, which, when slightly raised, would appear to be somewhat passionate.

He weakly pulled a pillow out from under his head and propped himself up slightly, glancing around his dorm room for the location of the sound.

He didn’t know whose alarm it was, but it had been ringing for such a long time. And, that person still didn’t get up to turn it off like a dead pig.

Xiao Chen squinted, found the right direction, and smashed the pillow hard on the head of the person facing him on the bed with a quick, hard blow.

“F*ck.” The man was shocked and bounced right off the bed. When he saw what the situation was, he couldn’t help but burst into a foul mouth and yelled, “Xiao Chen, you’re sick!”

Xiao Chen put his head against the bed rail, his face expressionless. His voice did not have any fluctuation, and his words were concise, “Turn off the alarm clock.”

Not sure if it was the alarm clock that had scared away his sleep or not, but after it was turned off, Xiao Chen couldn’t sleep. He dawdled on the bed for a long time before sitting up. 

He supported his head with his hand, feeling a bit of an inexplicable shift in his heart and tightness in his chest.

He seemed to have just had a nightmare.

Xiao Chen frowned, carefully recalling the dream he had just had. Still, somehow, he could only remember that it was scary, but he couldn’t retain the exact contents.

“You’re back?” There was some kind of low male voice that was attached to his ear, whispering out softly. There was also a tingly touch like it was talking to him across time and space. 

The voice was very familiar to him!

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows jumped, and he covered his heart as his heart rate suddenly became very fast. He looked around in fear, but there was nothing as if the connection had been cut off by something forcefully.

Damn.

Xiao Chen cursed under his breath and pressed his temples. 

How come there were hallucinations again.

This was not the first time.

Xiao Chen gasped, feeling a little stuffy. His current state was getting stranger and stranger. He always felt like his brain was empty like he had forgotten something important, and like there was a layer of fog blocking him. He tried very hard to push away this layer of fog, but it was always in vain, making him panicked even more.

Forget about it. 

Xiao Chen forced himself to calm down.

He looked at the entire dorm room and propped his head up. He contemplated silently by himself for half a moment, then asked weakly, “Where is Li Da? Why didn’t he come back last night.”

The boy who was beaten was probably just broken up by that pillow of Xiao Chen and also could not asleep. After hearing Xiao Chen’s question, he scratched his head, crawled up from the bed, and squinted his eyes. He swept a glance at Li Da’s bed and sighed, “Who knows which girl he went on a date with. Do you still not know him? Every week there is a new girlfriend.

Xiao Chen said, “Oh”, and continued to slump on the bed. 

After an unknown amount of time, the boy suddenly squeaked, “Xiao Chen, what are you mouthing off about? How come I don’t understand a word of it.”

Xiao Chen frowned, a bit not understanding what the boy meant, “What?”

Did he just say something?

The boy crossed his legs on the bed and hitched, “Just now, you jabbered a lot of alien language. Your voice was small, so I didn’t understand a single word.” 

Xiao Chen choked and looked over with complicated eyes, but he didn’t say anything. Still, it was hard to ignore the fact that the veins in his temples tensed up because of the boy’s words.

The boy sat on the bed and sneered.

Xiao Chen, this person is indeed a bit different. He is a bit isolated, with a not too good personality, and is often distracted. Still, his grades are soaring, and his IQ is very high. Not only that, but he also looks handsome. When the university opened that time, I don’t know how many sisters were thinking this piece of fat meat.

The boy is called Zhou Ming, and he continued carelessly, “Just like a devil, I also called out to you several times, but you didn’t respond to me.” 

Xiao Chen opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, and then suddenly realized something. He frowned, and closed his mouth tightly, then lay flat on the bed. Xiao Chen yanked the blanket down on himself with great force, covered his head with a death grip. He rolled over and faced the wall, looking as if he intended to continue sleeping. His voice was muffled under the blanket, “Okay, I got it. ”

–

“What’s your name?” The little boy leaned in front of the boy and blinked, a little curious.

“……” There was no answer. 

“Why don’t you say something?” The little boy was a little aggravated.

“……” Still, silence.

“Don’t you like me?” The little boy was a bit pissed off and pouted.

“……” Silence. 

Just as the little boy lowered his head down, thinking that he wouldn’t get a response, the other boy’s hand suddenly attached his head. The cold voice softly played on top of his head, and he heard the boy seriously say, “Like.”

–

Xiao Chen once again woke up from his dream, and his entire body had yet to calm down from this dream scene.

Unlike before, this time, this dream of his was very clear! He even remembered everything that had happened in the dream, so clearly that he could see the tiny pores on the man’s face, even hear the wind blowing… 

But strangely, even though he remembered every tiny detail of the dream, he could never remember the boy’s face in the dream. He could only vaguely feel that the person was good looking, soft and weak, and not talkative.

But this person became a blank part in his memory as if someone had rigidly erased the trace of that person’s existence.

He suspected that this was the part of his memory that he had lost.

Xiao Chen covered his chest and pressed his palm directly against something. He opened his mouth and slowly reached out to pull out the necklace inside his clothes. 

The pendant was in the shape of a sickle.

Xiao Chen’s Adam’s apple moved as he thought about something.

He actually couldn’t remember when it was worn around his neck. He could only have a vague feeling that this item was given to him by the most important person in his life.

So much so that every time he gazed at the necklace, he felt a surge of sadness and was close to tears. 

“Xiao Chen!!!” Zhou Ming slammed open the door and walked in through the door with a frightened face. His footsteps were very chaotic, and even his voice was a little breathless as he spoke. His legs were trembling a little, like a man who had suffered some great excitement.

Xiao Chen sat on the bed and locked eyes with him. He found that something was wrong and frowned, “What’s the matter?”

Zhou Ming’s chest was a bit heaving; his whole body was still scruffy and unkempt. He could tell that he should have just gone to buy breakfast.

“Da, Da-zi, he’s dead!!!” Zhou Ming paused, his eyes grew wide and bloodshot, and the whole sentence was almost yelled out in fear. 

Xiao Chen sat up, climbed down from the bed, and walked somewhat stiffly to Zhou Ming. He swallowed and asked, “What happened?”

It was not destined to be a peaceful day.

The entire school was in extreme panic as a male body was found in the school park.

The corpse was found by an old lady who had gotten up early to sell breakfast. 

It looked as if the face was soaked in water, swollen, and with pits resembling fish eggs, so it was hard to see who it was.

It was said that the old lady who found the body vomited on the spot and almost fainted, but still had half-consciousness before calling the police.

The police arrived, and through the deceased’s clothes in the ID card and student card, they confirmed that it was a school student, – Li Da.

But there was another point about the autopsy that the police did not reveal for fear of creating panic. 

The deceased’s vital parts seem to have been poured with acid. It was directly decomposed, entirely out of shape. The method of death was cruel; the deceased should have had consciousness during the torture for up to an hour before slowly dying. The cruelty of his death was chilling.

Xiao Chen and Zhou Ming stood in front of the announcement board of the suspension and rectification notice. Their expressions both felt a bit oozing. It could be seen that Xiao Chen was still okay, but Zhou Ming was almost too scared to sleep at night.

Xiao Chen didn’t know what to think, and his whole body was out of place. As soon as he turned around, he directly ran into someone – a girl who was shorter than him.

The girl looked in a somewhat weak state with her back bowed, and her bangs were blocking her eyes. She looked like the kind of cute girl who was popular with boys. She walked with her head down and didn’t look at anyone. She was wearing her school uniform that gave her an unexplainable feeling. 

The girl raised her head and saw Xiao Chen’s face clearly. Her eyes widened instantly, and she hurriedly ran away.

Xiao Chen was a little face blind, but Zhou Ming, surprisingly, understood everything except studying, especially remembering faces.

After the girl walked away, Zhou Ming bumped Xiao Chen with his elbow and said, “Eh, see, that girl is Li Da’s ex-girlfriend.”

Xiao Chen nodded at the words. He wasn’t a gossipy person and wasn’t very interested in such things. His tone was flat as if he was staring off into the distance, “He has so many ex-girlfriends, there’s nothing to be surprised about.” 

Zhou Ming did not seem like he was skipping this topic. He seriously said, “No, Li Da is scum with no bottom line. That girl is the only one among his previous girlfriends who is intact with him. She is also the one he has talked about for the longest time. However, they have only been together for two weeks. It is said that this girl has kneeled down in front of Li Da in public to get back together.

——If there really is a devil in this world who can grant my wish, then my wish is to let him live.




“Brother, I may not be able to come out to play with you anymore.” The little boy was wearing a large hospital gown, which covered his small body. His little face was so pale, his neck so white that you could even see his veins, but despite this, he tried to smile and pretended to be cheerful. Still, he couldn’t hide the hint of loss in his eyes. 

The boy stared into his eyes, didn’t say a word, and sat down on the stool. He put his hand on the other boy’s head and stroked his hair.

But it was impossible to ignore the fact that the back of his hand was full of needle marks. What was even more frightening was that the little finger of the boy’s right hand was broken! And it was obviously a fresh wound!

The boy’s eyes met the other’s; he narrowed his eyes, not knowing what he was thinking. Still, the little boy could feel the boy’s body visibly stiffen after he said his words. His breathing even stopped for a brief second, then became a little quicker.

The boy, who had always been silent, looked at him seriously and softly asked with a low voice, “Why?” 

The little boy’s eyes dodged, avoiding the boy’s gaze. Then, he scratched his head and lowered it to look at the ground, not daring to meet the boy’s eye, “That, I’m sick, aren’t I? I’ll be in quarantine for treatment, and then if I’m well, I’ll just be discharged.”

After the little boy had spoken, the other boy didn’t talk. The little boy had gotten used to his silence, his heart was sad, and his eyes filled with tears.

He didn’t dare and couldn’t tell him the real reason.

The boy nodded his head, and his eyes went around the little boy’s back, looking at the big tree outside the window. Through the glass, he could clearly see that the branches and leaves of the tree had yellowed and even started to wilt.

The boy narrowed his eyes, his expression somewhat shifting. He raised his head and suddenly said to the little boy, “Autumn is coming.”

The little boy was confused.

I don’t like autumn.

– 

Xiao Chen stared at the tree outside the window and looked to be in a trance for a moment before he suddenly reacted after being pushed by Zhou Ming beside him.

Xiao Chen returned to his senses and pointed at the tree outside the window, “Isn’t it summer now? Why is that tree all withered?”

Zhou Ming followed his gaze and casually said, “Who knows? They say it’s the school’s wishing tree. See the red ribbons hanging on the tree? It’s all hung by students, and the tree has been in the school for a long time, I think.”

Xiao Chen nodded. 

Zhou Ming narrowed his eyes and was not sure of what he saw. Suddenly, he went up to pick up Xiao Chen’s collar. Xiao Chen was shocked and started to break free of his hand, but he was also teased twice.

“Damn, Xiao Chen, you even got a tattoo! I didn’t see it before! The pattern is pretty unique.” Zhou Ming smiled mischievously and touched him twice at the location of his shoulder blades. Xiao Chen mercilessly knocked him straight down with his hand, and with a low voice, he said, “Don’t touch.”

Zhou Ming chuckled, feeling good, and wanted to touch a couple more times, but before he could put it into practice, and he didn’t know how he suddenly felt a shiver for no reason. His heart started to panic as if something had taken control of his body. There was an unreal feeling of being suspended in the air. His hand that was stretched out in mid-air was stuck there.

At this time, Xiao Chen was still touching the back of his neck innocently and was in deep thought. 

He actually couldn’t remember when he got this tattoo, as if he had it from the time he lost his memory.

And he didn’t have any memories from before he was ten.

But he had a gut feeling that he must have met someone important to him before he was ten years old.

Not only that, this tattoo was just like the pendant he had always hung around his neck. Even if he didn’t have a deep memory, he knew that it was incredibly precious to him. 

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen subconsciously clutched the pendant.

It was as important as his life. No one could touch it!

“You’re back?” Low and gloomy, someone was talking.

Xiao Chen became a little stiff, and his lips began to turn pale. 

He heard the voice again.

Zhou Ming finally calmed down and covered his heart, gasping for breath as if he had been dreaming. He was now panicking at the sight of Xiao Chen’s face; he stammered, “Xiao, Xiao Chen, I’m going to use the bathroom first. You don’t need to worry about me, you can go first.”

Before Xiao Chen could reply, Zhou Ming hurriedly ran away.

Xiao Chen pursed his lips and shook his head, and the voice disappeared. 

His gaze couldn’t help but drop onto the large, yellow tree outside the window.

This tree was strange; it felt out of place in the world when it stood there. Even though its trunk was withered and yellow, it had a robust and sturdy feel to it. It was incredibly strange when it was accompanied by other large green trees.

–

“Can you hear the trees?” The boy sat in his chair, looking out through the window at the big trees, and suddenly spoke out. 

“Can trees talk too?” The little boy was confused.

The boy’s expression remained the same, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned, but for some reason, there was a sense of irony to it, “Of course.”

“What would it say?” The little boy was confused.

The boy didn’t answer, just stroked the other’s hair, smiled, and said softly, “Maybe one day, you’ll be able to hear.” 

–

Xiao Chen covered his head as some more incomplete and trivial images flashed through his head. He saw two boys.

Very familiar.

Xiao Chen felt like he had a headache. 

But before Xiao Chen could think about it, his eyes were drawn to something else. He noticed that it was Li Da’s ex-girlfriend, which Zhou Ming mentioned yesterday, appeared downstairs.

Of course, there was no way that Xiao Chen noticed her without reason.

The girl’s state looked a bit strange.

This was Xiao Chen’s first impression. 

Xiao Chen, who was now standing on the library’s second floor by the window, was a bit confused and stood up, leaning against the window to watch the person’s strange behavior.

The girl looked even uglier than yesterday’s state. Her hair was unkempt and even a little oily. She was still wearing the same school uniform, and from a great distance, he could see that her face was a bit waxy, giving him the illusion that she had aged more than ten years overnight.

No, maybe it wasn’t an illusion.

Xiao Chen fixed his eyes. 

Around the girl, anyone who passed by her couldn’t help but look at her with an expression that contained a bit of horror and even disgust that couldn’t be concealed.

The girl lowered her head down. Compared to yesterday’s state, she seemed to be more cowering, even subconsciously covering her face, as if she didn’t want to be seen.

There weren’t many people on this side of the library, and few people passed by. After the girl was sure that everyone was gone, she looked around with wide eyes before withdrawing her gaze.

Next, Xiao Chen saw a scene that made him baffled. 

This girl was just like a spider. She used both her hands and legs together, her limbs attached to the tree trunk, and then gently climbed up. The whole process was swift and quick, the total time did not add up to more than half a minute, and then her entire body was blocked by the withered tree branches.

Xiao Chen concentrated on the scene in front of him, his Adam’s apple moved, and he did not know how long it took before the girl jumped down from the trunk.

But once again, Xiao Chen’s eyes widened.

For whatever reason, the girl’s originally waxy and yellow face became fair again. Even the condition was many times better than what he saw yesterday. 

There was a vivid image of returning from being an older woman to being a young girl.

The girl quickly fled the scene, not even noticing that someone was standing at the second-floor window staring at her the whole time.

Xiao Chen was horrified and covered his nose and mouth, his body becoming stiff.

“What’s the matter? The whole day has been soul-crushing!” Zhou Ming recovered as he happily played with his game console. He looked at Xiao Chen’s face with his peripheral view. 

Xiao Chen came back to his senses. He thought about the girl he saw today and hesitantly asked, “That ex-girlfriend of Da Zi we saw yesterday, what’s her name?”

Zhou Ming’s hand holding the game console shook and almost fell to the ground. He did not have time to care about the “game over” words on the screen. He looked at Xiao Chen, “Wait a minute! You don’t have a crush on her, do you?”

Not waiting for Xiao Chen’s answer, Zhou Ming continued, “I can tell you, I’m not going to say anything like friend’s wife can’t be bullied, this kind of bullshit. I promise I won’t say a word if you look at Da Zi’s other ex-girlfriends, but I’m telling you! Just her! Absolutely not!”

Xiao Chen tried to open his mouth to explain, but Zhou Ming continued like a bazooka, “You were concentrating on preparing for the 8th Grade English Exam during that time, so you didn’t know! But the whole school pretty much knows about it! Didn’t she break up with Da Zi? And then knelt in front of Da Zi and begged to be reunited. That’s not all. You have no idea what kind of drama followed!” 

Zhou Ming swallowed, “She set up a relationship with Da Zi to keep him, and even got pregnant, thinking that Li Da wouldn’t abandon her! This girl is too stupid! The whole school knows about the incident! Her parents even made a scene at school! They dragged her by her hair and took her to have an abortion.”

Xiao Chen blinked and frowned.

He was aware that Li Da was very unscrupulous. Their relationship was just so-so, there wasn’t much interaction between them. Still, they were roommates and had feelings for each other, after all. And in the whole school, he was also the one who had the best relationship with Zhou Ming. Of course, this might be related to Zhou Ming’s grinning personality.

Zhou Ming sighed, “But I heard that this girl’s grades are very good, and she’s going to be admitted to graduate school. Otherwise, she would have been expelled after this big thing happened. This is all because the school is reluctant to let go of such a good seedling.” 

Xiao Chen nodded his head in understanding.

When Zhou Ming saw him looking calm, he couldn’t help but frown, “I’ve said so much, do you understand? You mustn’t touch this girl!”

Xiao Chen glanced at him, “I don’t like her.”

Zhou Ming stared at Xiao Chen for two seconds. There was no doubt about it, and he let out a sigh of relief, “You should have said so! Then why did you ask her name for? I’ll have to think about it! Wait a minute, let me think of her name. Oh! Yes, yes, yes! Her name is Wang Jingyi!” 

Xiao Chen nodded and didn’t speak again.

——If there really was a shop in this world where you could pawn anything, what would you pawn? And what would you want?

——Remember, here, you can only pawn, not redeem.

——Unless, of course, you’re willing to use something new to pawn back what you already have.




“Eh, do you know Wang Jingyi?” 

“Pfft, who doesn’t know her! Why? Does the police suspect that she killed Li Da?”

“Haha, you don’t say, she’s quite suspicious! But that’s not what I’m talking about.”

“Then what is it?”

“Did you see yesterday’s grade rankings? Hasn’t she always been one of the top in our department? She was at the bottom of the class yesterday! Oh, my God! And you don’t know, a few days ago she looked like she’s aged a decade, but today she’s back to her teenage skin! It’s as if she’s been possessed!” 

“Eh! You don’t say! In today’s open class, I was in the same classroom as her, and the teacher asked her a question. That question was particularly simple that even I could answer it. I don’t know what’s wrong with her. She stood for a long time without answering.”

Along the way, there was always someone chattering and gossiping non-stop; three or two people got together to talk about gossip.

This was the fourth time that Xiao Chen had heard someone say the name Wang Jingyi today.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen paused. He couldn’t help but whisper her name, with a somewhat trance-like expression, “Wang Jingyi.”

Xiao Chen felt the air around him freeze, and a wind from nowhere stirred his bangs. Xiao Chen was wearing thick glasses, with his bangs blocking his eyes. The wind blew, making these eyes exposed.

Xiao Chen subconsciously blocked it with his hand.

The sun’s light shone directly on his hand, warming it.

“Hey, Xiao Chen.” A boy suddenly turned out from the corner. His eyes lit up when he saw Xiao Chen, his hands hugged Xiao Chen directly in his arms, and raised his eyebrows, “Let’s go! Something’s come up for you!” 

Xiao Chen held his glasses up and consciously pushed them, narrowing his eyes.

Something was wrong.

“Hey,” the boy’s name was Wang Yeze. He was in the same class as Xiao Chen, but they hadn’t actually said more than ten words together. They weren’t so close that they could hook up, “Xiao Chen, let’s go! Let’s go eat!”

Xiao Chen raised his eyebrows and glanced at him. His eyes were rippling but transparent. The latter’s eyes subconsciously dodged a bit… Xiao Chen sneered and stared at him quietly, without speaking. 

Wang Yeze was embarrassed to be looked at. Xiao Chen was clearly wearing glasses. He couldn’t even see Xiao Chen’s expression, but somehow being stared at by him would give him a feeling of naked shame, as if there was no way to hide those dirty thoughts in his heart.

Wang Yeze seemed to still want to say something. His hand that was hooked around Xiao Chen’s neck suddenly accidentally touched something, and his hand instantly trembled. He felt a piercing coldness all over his body as if something had invaded his brain. He shuddered and let go of Xiao Chen in shock.

Xiao Chen coldly looked at Wang Yeze.

Wang Yeze withdrew his hand, gritted his teeth, and clenched his two hands into fists. He dryly laughed, “Fine, fine, if you don’t want to go, I’ll find someone else.” 

After saying that, Wang Yeze fled the scene. He only took three or four steps and then glanced back at Xiao Chen quietly, with a somewhat unpredictable expression.

Xiao Chen pushed his frames back and stared at Wang Yeze’s back in contemplation.

Wang Yeze was a bit fidgety on his feet. Although he had just done his best to hide his inner anxiety with a smile, the hands around his neck were tense. His left eyelid was unconsciously throbbing, and he even made multiple attempts to arch his nose and scratch his cheek.

He was lying. 

That was the first thought that came to Xiao Chen’s mind.

According to a study by Feldman, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts, the average person lies at least 25 times a day. These lies may have good intentions or even be nothing more than one small thing, but the lies are present in almost everyone.

Even a person who was extremely good at lying would feel ill in the process of lying.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen subconsciously touched the pendant on his neck, and his gaze went over to the path that Wang Yeze had turned to just now. 

This path was narrow, and there were very few people walking on it. It only led to one place – the library.

Once again, Xiao Chen thought of the strange tree under the library.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen paused and unconsciously started walking in the direction of the library.

Wang Yeze’s footsteps stopped. He was breathing heavily, and his expression still showed some residual shock. 

He clenched his fist.

What was going on? Why is this Xiao Chen’s character somewhat different from the character of Xiao Chen in the movie?

Wang Yeze clenched his teeth, his face slightly twisted.

Calling out in exasperation, ‘System, what’s going on? How could this NPC have such a strong mental power.” 

A yellow dot slowly condensed above Wang Yeze’s head, and a bunch of garbled-like things vaguely appeared on the yellow dot.

‘The system doesn’t know. The player is asked to solve it on their own.’

Wang Yeze couldn’t help but gulp after hearing the System’s reply and cursing a few words under his breath.

He wasn’t from this world! This was a movie world! A horror film called The Devil’s Game! 

He was a murderer about to be executed! He didn’t know why he’d been chosen to come here by someone named System, but he did know that if he couldn’t complete the mission, he’d be sent back and put to death!

How willing he was.

The only content of his mission was to find the Devil’s Bride and kill her.

The movie “The Devil’s Game” is about a college where strange things happen frequently. 

The male student who died in a park with a completely unrecognizable face, the young girl who aged overnight, the bully who went into a manic knife-wielding murder spree ……

Wang Yeze, who has seen the original movie, knows that the source of all these evils comes from the withered wishing tree at the school library.

Anyone filled with bitterness or malice has to write a wish on a red cloth with their own blood and hang the fabric on the top of the wishing tree to awaken a devil, who will appear on earth and grant their wish.

And as the price for summoning it, these people would also need to exchange their most precious things for an equal price. 

Wang Yeze gritted his teeth at the thought of this. It was because he had seen the original story that he found his mission even stranger.

Searching for the Devil’s Bride?

There’s only one Devil in the world, and that’s Satan, the one summoned by the wishing tree. But he didn’t even know that this Devil actually had a bride in this movie.

That’s weird! 

Who’s the bride?

Wang Yeze began to recall the plot like crazy.

In this movie, the main character is Zhou Ming. The main supporting characters are Xiao Chen, Wang Jingyi, and Wang Yeze……. After the truth is revealed, only Zhou Ming is left alive. He burns down the wishing tree to prevent the Devil from coming to earth again.

The only reference to the Devil’s origins is very simple; this Devil was once a human. He traded his life with the previous Devil as the price for granting his wish. He became the new Devil, and for the rest of his life, he had to be chained to the Wishing Tree, granting wishes for greedy humans and looking for a chance to escape. 

But throughout the movie, it was never stated at all what the wish the Devil once redeemed was.

——What is your wish?

——I, I hope he gets better! And never be locked up in that little room again.

——Well, what would you trade for it?

——I… I don’t know what I could trade.

——Your life!

“Doctor! Doctor!” The woman’s screams were piercingly loud throughout the hospital. Her legs trembled, and her hands clung to the wall as if she had been frightened. She rushed out of the ward, but before she could run a few steps, she fell straight to her knees in place and shouted at the top of her lungs, “Someone help me! Somebody help!!!”

“My son’s illness has struck again! Somebody do something!!!” The woman was shouting down the corridor like a crazy person. It was the middle of the night, and there was no one at all in the hospital. 

Her voice directly turned on the sound switch in the hallway.

A group of nurses on duty rushed out in a flurry, “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with the patient?”

The woman gasped and pointed her trembling fingers at the door as if she was choking and didn’t speak.

The nurses look at each other. Seeing this, the head nurse leaned into the isolation window, intending to see the situation inside. 

Her eyes widened, and she was in a state of shock.

The usually quiet and gentle boy inside was sitting on the bed without moving, speaking, or doing anything drastic. He was just sitting there quietly as usual, like a decoration.

Of course, if the room wasn’t as if some beast had swept through it. There were countless traces of tables and chairs smashed. It was hard for her to imagine that someone who was just like the image of a noble son would go crazy to this extent.

No! Not only that! 

The head nurse’s eyes widened as if she had seen something else. Her pupils constricted, and her eyes filled with such horror that even the hand gripping the isolation window trembled.

The boy’s right hand had broken a finger, and the wound at that broken finger was bleeding continuously!

What’s even worse is that the severed finger was just right there in the boy’s hands!

But his expression was flat from start to finish, without the slightest fluctuation of emotion, like it wasn’t even him who was injured, and he couldn’t feel any pain. 

The head nurse’s breathing became shaky, and her eyelids couldn’t stop fluttering.

This patient was the most special in the entire hospital!

He has a very rare form of bipolar disorder in this world!

Thinking of this, the head nurse immediately shouted to the other nurses in the back, “Quick! Go get the keys!” 

The boy lifted his head slowly, eyes squinting as if trying to see through the isolation window.

The head nurse swallowed and waited a little anxiously for the nurse who ran to get the keys.

Suddenly, the boy’s mouth quirked upwards, showing his teeth. His neck tilted to the side, looking well-behaved and secretive. His eyes seemed to fall directly on her through the window, making her shudder.

“Sister!” A child’s clear voice sounded at the end of the hallway, breaking the weirdness. 

The nurse turned back with a jolt.

A boy stood around the corner, his fingers gripping the corner of the wall, his watery eyes wide and innocent, gazing at the scene before him.

“What’s going on in there, sister?”

In the room, the boy’s originally emotionless expression seemed to crack instantly as if he heard the noise outside, and his breath was slightly constricted. 

No, don’t let him see me like this right now!

——You are my medicine. The only light, the only salvation that can soothe my anxious heart and help me drive away my loneliness during these long, lonely years.

Please, don’t abandon me!





Xiao Chen was dumbfounded, and his eyes were a little lost. Then, as if lost in thought, he slowly reached out his hand and gently stroked the bark of the tree. His movement was very light; it could be said to be gentle as if he was caressing his beloved. His eyes also had an inexplicable affection. 

He paused, as if something had flashed through his mind, and frowned.

The moment his palm touched the bark of the tree, he seemed to be able to feel some slight change in the tree.

There was even a gentle breeze that blew over, stirring the leaves, which blew off the ground and into his face.

It was subtle, like someone was gently caressing his face. It doesn’t feel like a leaf but rather like a spiritual being. 

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen squatted down, grabbed a handful of soil in his hand, and poured it out again. He tilted his head up to look at the top of the tree and was somewhat distracted. He didn’t know whether he noticed something or not, but his eyes shifted down unconsciously, and then his gaze was fixed on the flower bed behind the tree.

He squinted his eyes, stood up, and began to step backward, examining the scene in front of him with a serious look.

The tree at this angle, the flower bed, and the antenna pole looming in the distance behind the school building ……

Very familiar.

Xiao Chen propped his head up and frowned.

Several scattered images flashed through his head like fragments. The scenery in front of him was very similar to the scenes in his mind, but not quite the same.

It was like he’d…

He had been here a long time ago… 

Xiao Chen pursed his lips, his expression somewhat heavy. He paused, then propped his hand on his temple.

In his head, just ……

It seemed as if two people had just flashed by.

Xiao Chen gritted his teeth. 

He had no memory of anything before the age of ten. He had no idea what he had been through before that, but he had not lived in the city since he could remember! If it weren’t for college, he would have never gotten here at all!

But then again.

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes.

He had also chosen this place because he had an unexplainable feeling in his heart about it as if he had been called back. 

Unless…

He lived here before the age of ten!

Xiao Chen felt a little absurd but somewhat certain.

How in the world could there be such a coincidence! 

It was true that ever since he’d arrived in the city, bits, and pieces of that lost part of his memory would flash through his mind.

He…

And the sound of a man’s voice…

– 

“Take off your shirt.” The boy’s expression was bland, like he was stating a trivial matter as simple as that.

A little confused, the other looked back at him, nodded, and replied stupidly, “Ooooh.”

The little boy obeyed and took his shirt off. In the process of pulling his shirt off, he also messed up his hair in confusion and showed a frizz.

When the boy saw this scene, the corners of his mouth couldn’t stop rising. He showed a slight smile and touched the hair on his head, smoothing it down with a bit of affection. 

Then he turned and took the pillow from the sofa and said, in a warm voice, “Hold this pillow, and lean against the table, with your back to me, and don’t be afraid.”

The other trusted him and did everything he was told.

The boy nodded and put on his gloves and mask so that his face was not visible. He narrowed his eyes and picked up the flashlight from the side, pausing to shine it on the other’s shoulder blades.

The boy’s gaze was soft as if he was examining a work of art, his eyes curved at the corners. He picked up the tattoo machine from the couch and softly reassured, “It might hurt a little, are you afraid?” 

The little boy pursed his lips and turned his head around. His eyes clear and unreservedly trusting, and his voice was crisp and incredibly sincere, “Not afraid.”

As if he felt the words were not strong enough, he tilted his head again and added, “I trust you.”

The boy’s hand paused, his grey eyes somewhat dark, not knowing what he was thinking about. Three seconds passed; he closed his eyes and reopened them, looking serious, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you feel much pain!”

I swear! 

The boy sucked in a breath.

The shape of this tattoo always appeared in his dreams.

A snake wrapped around a delicate rose.

The snake spat out its tongue, and its entire body was clinging to the delicate rose. Its crystal eyes seemed to shoot out a cold light. The snake’s shape was much larger than the rose, and the rose’s body was full of thorns. As if it couldn’t feel pain, the snake cradled the rose in its embrace. Also, fearing that its strength would hurt the rose, the snake’s tail rested on the ground and embraced the rose in a strange position. 

From the time he dreamed of this picture, he would think of Xiao Chen and knew that only by tattooing this picture onto his baby’s body would he have a sense of peace.

Xiao Chen…

Is his only treasure.

To one day be able to tattoo this pattern onto the other, he had taught himself to draw for a long time for this purpose and even consulted countless books related to tattoos. 

The boy’s strength was light, but it was inevitable that blood would gush out from the wound. He frowned, his eyes having an unconcealed distress.

But he didn’t stop working on the creation in his hands.

When the tattoo was finally complete, the boy’s hands were all dense with sweat. He let out a breath, hooked his lips, placed the gauze over the other’s tattoo, and helped him with the remaining disinfection.

There was an unspoken satisfaction in the way his eyes stared at the other’s shoulder blades. 

It’s so lovely that you’re still with me.

Perhaps the waiting process was too boring, but the other had long since fallen asleep, hugging the pillow with his eyes closed.

The boy saw this and laughed out softly, his laughter filled with some spoiling.

He got up, picked up the blanket from the bed, covered the other boy with it. Then, he carefully cradled the boy in his arms, lifting him gently in a princess hug. 

Each step was a steady one.

He placed the boy on the bed and devoutly grasped both of the other’s hands in his own and placed them on his forehead.

Good night, my little rose.

– 

As if Wang Yeze had caught the bug of the mission of some sort, the corners of his mouth suddenly turned upward. He called out to the system inwardly, ‘System, tell me, is the Devil’s bride in these key figures?’

The garbled code above his head grew, and it was only when Wang Yeze was getting really impatient with the wait did the system finally gave a response, “Yes.”

Wang Yeze raised an eyebrow at the words.

“Then, if I kill all the key figures, will my mission be complete?” 

The system that had always regulated Wang Yeze’s every move was silent for a long time as if it was trying to communicate with something else.

Finally, Wang Yeze glanced at his head with some impatience before he heard the system reply like this, “Yes, as long as you can do it.”

–

Xiao Chen eased out of his trance as if something had slipped into his mind. 

“Xiao Chen?!” A harsh shout came from the distance.

Xiao Chen froze and turned around, dazed by the scene before him.

It was two men who looked to be in their thirties.

Xiao Chen remained still in place, without speaking. 

Something was wrong.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen couldn’t help but take a step back, his eyes full of caution.

The two men looked at each other and then walked over to Xiao Chen in both left and right directions as if they intended to block his retreat.

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes, a little guarded. 

One of the men clearly saw Xiao Chen’s nervousness and pulled out an ID from his pocket, spreading it out so that Xiao Chen could read the words inside.

It was the police.

Xiao Chen opened his mouth but didn’t say anything; his eyebrows furrowed slightly.

“We need your cooperation, and we hope you would come back to the police station with us for an interview.” The man’s tone was not an order, but the words carried an attitude that could not be refused. 

Xiao Chen’s hand clutched the pendant. He was calm in his heart, his expression light as he asked, “Why?”

One of the male policemen didn’t expect him to be so easy to talk to. He glanced around and patiently explained, “Regarding the matter of Li Da, we need you to cooperate with us to do some investigation.”

Xiao Chen nodded and glanced at the two, agreeing to follow their request.

But Xiao Chen knew deep down that things could never be that simple. 

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen looked at the two beside him.

One of them had his right hand in his pocket all the time. Xiao Chen could guess from the shape that it contained handcuffs, while his other hand was holding a walkie-talkie. The man had a serious expression as if he was always ready for something.

The other person also looked very tense. He intentionally stopped on Xiao Chen’s right side; the distance between him was subtly controlled within one meter as if he was worried that he would resist.

If it was really a simple inquiry, an investigation, then their reaction was far too severe. 

Something was very wrong!!!

Unless…

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes.

There was only one possibility. 

They regarded him as the suspect in Li Da’s murder.

“How is your relationship with Li Da?”

Xiao Chen calmly sat at the interrogation table, scanning the entire room’s furnishings, as well as the officer who questioned him with a cold expression, and replied, “A dorm roommate, not very familiar.”

This officer looked skilled in experience, swept a glance at Xiao Chen’s demeanor. He wrote something unknown in his notebook and continued to ask, “Where were you on the night of October 19? What did you do? Is there anyone who can attest to that?” 

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes. His expression appeared to be in a trance for two seconds as if he was remembering the events of that day. The officer keenly noticed the change in Xiao Chen.

“Sleeping, in the dorm room, Zhou Ming was also there.” Xiao Chen spoke concisely.

The policeman smiled, his eyes burning, “Is that so? You sleepwalk, right?”

Xiao Chen’s hands and feet faltered, his breath caught, and cracks appeared on his originally unruffled face. 

The officer picked up a folder from a nearby table, “I heard that you have a history of self-harming while sleepwalking.”

Xiao Chen didn’t say anything, and the two looked at each other.

The officer stared at Xiao Chen’s expression and continued blankly, “You don’t like Li Da.”

Xiao Chen scowled and met the policeman’s probing gaze. 

The officer closed the folder and said, “Your mother was abandoned by your father, and you, in turn, were abandoned by your mother.”

“So even if you don’t show it, in your heart, you detest people like Li Da, who just casually consume other people’s feelings.”

Silently, the police officer stared at Xiao Chen’s every move, as if hoping to harvest some useful information from his expression.

Xiao Chen did not shy away from locking eyes with him. 

While the police officer’s expression became increasingly serious, Xiao Chen seemed to have discovered something, then puffed out a laugh.

The officer’s serious face stiffened for a moment, and he couldn’t help but ask, “What are you laughing at?”

Xiao Chen placed both hands on the interrogation table and crossed his legs as if he had heard some funny joke, “Officer,” Xiao Chen began.

“Since you already know my medical history, you should understand that I am a mental patient.” Xiao Chen paused, “As an interrogator, you should also know that with mental patients, they would be even less able to recognize and defend themselves against mind control strategies.” 

Xiao Chen laughed, “And you interrogators, deliberately put invisible pressure on the interrogated during the interrogation process. Even going so far as to use the ‘suspect’s guilt theory’ to directly ignore all kinds of doubts and use psychological tactics to force the interrogated to confess.”

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes, his eyes emitting a cold light, “But this set of tactics doesn’t apply to mental patients, does it?”

The officer’s cold sweat flowed down, his Adam’s apple moved, and his body tensed a bit. Even his fingers couldn’t help but clench into fists.

Xiao Chen paused, his eyes falling to the other’s body, examining him up and down, “You are a new cop, right?” 

The police officer raised his head fiercely and met his eyes.

Xiao Chen laughed, “From the moment you entered this room, the veins on your temples have been bulging. Even though you tried to relax, you could hardly hide the tension in your appearance. During the interrogation, even your hands were trembling slightly when you were writing. And, you could only soothe your anxious heart with the help of flipping through the documents during the interrogation of me.

Xiao Chen tilted his head with a bit of careless oppression, “Are you that nervous? Officer!”

“Boom!” The door swung open, and a woman in a police uniform, with short hair and a thunderous look, appeared. 

The male police officer was covered in cold sweat, swallowed his saliva, looked back at the woman nervously, and weakly opened his mouth, “Captain.”

The woman swept a glance at Xiao Chen, waved her hand, and let the male police officer out. The officer pursed his lips and couldn’t resist looking back at Xiao Chen again. He didn’t say anything and just silently bypassed the woman and walked out.

Unlike the man just now, the woman didn’t sit directly on the interrogation chair. Instead, she took a big step, grabbed the chair, and then sat down in front of Xiao Chen without a care in the world, looking at him equally in a straight line.

She opened her mouth and quirked her lips, “So, what do you think about me talking with you next?” 

–



Xiao Chen raised his head, did not say anything, and met her eyes with a calm expression. 

The woman was not aggressive, and her expression could be regarded as friendly as she smiled. But in the next second, her eyes became sharp, instantly became fiery, and she stared at Xiao Chen’s eyes.

Neither of them spoke.

Under the dim light, their expressions were somewhat unreadable, with a bit of secrecy.

Finally, the woman was the first to break the strange silence and thoughtfully said to Xiao Chen. “Student Xiao Chen, are you sure you didn’t sleepwalk that day?” 

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes slightly at the words. The lenses blocked his expression, so the woman couldn’t see much of a change in his appearance. His voice carried a unique huskiness, “Why are you so suspicious of me?”

He paused, as if he had thought of something, and calmly analyzed, “As police officers, you should have known that analyzing the composition of a crime from a legal point of view, four basic conditions must be met at the same time: subject, object, subjective aspect, and objective aspect“.

Xiao Chen’s expression remained unchanged. His tone was light, and he presented the facts with a calm face. “The perpetrator sleepwalking belongs to the non-conscious state. The harmful acts that he commits will not be able to constitute a crime at all because he does not have the subjective conditions.”

Xiao Chen watched the woman’s every move and continued, “If Li Da was really killed by me while sleepwalking, don’t you also know that I am equally able to use the legal means to defend myself and even get off the hook.”

The woman’s fingers were clenched, and her expression was grave.

Because every word that Xiao Chen said was correct.

Xiao Chen looked at the woman and used his hand to slightly prop up his glasses. The lenses flashed a little because of the reflection. He calmly continued his statement, “I don’t deny that I sleepwalk and have a mental illness,” He raised his eyebrows up and stared at the woman’s expression with a deadly glare, “but”

“I do not believe that these can constitute grounds for you to doubt me.” 

For a moment, the entire room fell into a deadlock again.

After Xiao Chen spoke, he held the pendant on his neck with his right hand and gently rubbed it, as if he was caressing some kind of treasure. He glanced at the watch on the woman’s wrist, withdrew his hand, and gently opened his lips with some certainty, “Officer, time is up, can I go now?”

They used psychological warfare to get at him, so these people left him alone in this closed interrogation room from the beginning. The closed environment, the oppressive lighting, the mirror in front of him with nowhere to hide were all to try to break down his psychological defenses, a common psychological tactic used by the police to interrogate criminals.

But. 

Xiao Chen pursed the corners of his lips.

These things, to him, were nothing.

The woman’s face changed slightly when she heard Xiao Chen’s words, but before she could respond, a sudden rush of footsteps hurriedly approached outside the door.

“Puff!” Once again, the door was opened hastily – by a male police officer. 

The woman turned back at the sound, and her face was ugly.

The male officer fixed himself in his place and glanced at Xiao Chen in the doorway. When he saw the latter’s probing gaze, he couldn’t help but tighten his grip.

His eyes moved, and his eyebrows went up, hinting at the woman with his eyes.

The woman immediately stood up and glanced at Xiao Chen before leaving, as if she had many complicated emotions. She had a heavy expression, but she didn’t say anything and quickly retreated from the room. 

Xiao Chen sat in the room without much movement.

With his eyes downcast and bangs covering his eyes, he resembled a fragile porcelain doll with delicate features. The lights in the room shone on his face, giving him a sense of beauty that could not be explained.

Suddenly, Xiao Chen seemed to feel something, and his eyebrows jumped violently.

It was as if something like a soft tentacle started to slowly attach to his temple from the back of his head and parted the stray hair on his forehead. It even slipped past his glasses and touched the corner of his eye. 

The movement of that unknown thing was very light. It was so light that it could almost be ignored, but in this weird, dull, and quiet room, the feeling would be infinitely magnified, making it impossible to ignore it.

Xiao Chen subconsciously clutched the pendant around his neck, which was his usual action when he wanted to gain psychological comfort.

At this moment, his five senses had been amplified to the extent that he could clearly hear his own breathing, not to mention that numbing touch.

Xiao Chen swallowed his saliva. There was a bit of panic and excitement. He couldn’t help but grit his teeth and curse a couple of times in his heart. 

Damn it. It was this strange feeling again.

Before Xiao Chen could comfort himself that this was all just an illusion, his body became stiff in the next second.

“Don’t be afraid.” Someone attached to his ear and breathed. The fuzzy touch caused him to shiver.

Xiao Chen was a little panicked, and the placement of his legs were all a little confused. He began to frantically make mental notes to himself, and his entire body involuntarily attached itself to the table, supporting his head with his hands. His fingers squeezed into a fist, trying to ease himself out of this so-called hallucination. 

But!

This hallucination was more real than any of the previous ones!

So real that he couldn’t even fool himself that it was an illusion!

Xiao Chen could even feel that there was another frequency of breathing in this room apart from himself. It was fast, like an athlete who couldn’t breathe properly after a run, not like a person’s normal breathing, but instead like it was because of tension. 

Xiao Chen’s fingers were stiff as he listened to that person’s heartbeat.

What’s going on! It was too real!

That person’s cold hands touched his shoulders. Xiao Chen’s body became rigid at the moment of being touched. His breathing stalled, but those hands seemed to feel Xiao Chen’s discomfort and patted his back gently. However, his movements didn’t stop because of that, and he was still moving slowly. The movements were gentle, as if they were teasing.

Finally, not knowing how long it had been moving, those hands stopped! 

Xiao Chen sucked in a breath of cold air at the moment he stopped.

That hand stopped at the position of his shoulder blade. Even the fingers were intentionally or unintentionally tracing the location of his tattoo.

His body’s sensitive points were different from those of other people. This tattoo was one of his sensitive points; that’s why he reacted so badly when Zhou Ming touched him there.

It was as if someone let out a soft laugh in the silent room, and this laugh carried an inexplicable lingering feeling. 

Xiao Chen paused when he heard this laugh. His expression instantly became somewhat dumbfounded; even his body unconsciously relaxed after hearing the laughter. Like a reflex arc, the body has muscle memory. He would relax and even open his heart because of this familiar laugh, even though his brain still resisted the situation.

Just as Xiao Chen was stunned, the door of the interrogation room opened once again.

Xiao Chen looked over in a trance. The fascinating fluttering around him dissipated as if what had just happened was just Xiao Chen’s imagination.

The woman stood at the door, her expression even more serious than when they first saw each other. She stood quietly at the door, like an iceberg, “Student Xiao Chen, you can leave now!” 

Xiao Chen slowly stood up and quickly returned to his senses. He patted his clothes, and in the next second, clutched the pendant around his neck. He met the woman’s searching eyes as he walked to the door. The woman looked thoughtfully at the pendant around Xiao Chen’s neck, but her demeanor was no longer as cold as it was when she was interrogating him just now.

After delivering Xiao Chen to the entrance of the police station herself, the woman nodded at Xiao Chen. She moved her chin slightly in the direction of the outside, indicating that he could leave.

Xiao Chen looked at her back and scanned her up and down, not in a hurry to leave.

This woman was not dressed like an ordinary policeman. From the way she had just interrogated him and how the other officers had treated her, he was almost certain. 

She was a detective!

What else could it be that would make a detective rush to deal with it?

It was murder.

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes, thinking of the male officer who had just called the woman out. 

The general detective can handle several new cases simultaneously. There are usually only two kinds of things that can make him so eager to inform the woman.

Finding the key clue, the suspect, while the other kind was the emergence of a murder closely related to the following case.

So, was it possible that a murder had appeared that was linked to Li Da?

Wang Jingyi’s body was found in the swimming pool near the library. It had been a full thirty hours since her death, and….. 

…her body was found to be completely devoid of blood and stiff. Her features even more so because she had been in the water for too long. Her nose had bled profusely, and her body had become very rigid.

The swimming pool where Wang Jingyi was found has long been abandoned for several years. The water in the pool was yellow wastewater. The location was nearby the library, where very few people would pass by.

Who would have thought that a murder could happen just inside the school campus where people were dead for a day and a night, and the body was only discovered because it floated up.

This was no longer just a simple case. The school’s security facilities, monitoring equipment, the management of dormitory bed-checking situations… all have a large number of hidden threats. 

The school, which was already in a frenzy because of Li Da’s matter, became even more anxious and started to deal with the emergency PR.

The students were even more terrified. The entire school was in a tacit depression, fearing that the next disaster would be their own, and they started to be cautious.

Xiao Chen returned to the school and learned the news of Wang Jingyi’s death almost immediately.

When Xiao Chen returned, Zhou Ming was playing a game in his dorm room with his legs crossed and a lollipop in his mouth. He only looked up and called out to him politely when Xiao Chen entered the door, seemingly not even half curious about where he had gone last night. 

Xiao Chen’s keen sense of Zhou Ming’s whole person was very tense. Although every move was no different from usual, Xiao Chen was gifted in observing people, not to mention that he and Zhou Ming were in the same dorm room and had a good relationship.

Xiao Chen squinted his eyes and took a look around to see the changes inside the dorm room.

Zhou Ming’s trash can was not full. The trash inside was still yesterday’s trash, not in line with Zhou Ming’s Garbage King style. Not only that, Xiao Chen could almost see at a glance that Zhou Ming’s blanket was still folded as it was yesterday morning. Even the part of the sheet that was protruding due to the laying out was without any difference.

Xiao Chen was almost sure that Zhou Ming hadn’t slept in his dorm room last night, either. 

Probably because Xiao Chen’s expression was too serious, Zhou Ming felt uncomfortable being stared at. He raised his head, laughed dryly twice, and took the initiative to speak, “Why didn’t you come back to the dorm yesterday?”

Xiao Chen lowered his head. His sharp observation ability allowed him to notice things that ordinary people wouldn’t notice. His EQ and personality dictated that he wouldn’t actively embarrass others and make himself look bad. Still, he was also an extremely sensitive person.

Xiao Chen sat on his chair, “Something happened that needed to be dealt with.” He didn’t want to say that he had gone to the police station, so he wouldn’t ask back at Zhou Ming why he hadn’t gone back to his dorm room yesterday as well.

Zhou Ming nodded his head sensibly and no longer spoke. 

Xiao Chen restrained his eyes and opened his own drawer, and when he got a good look at what was inside, his eyebrows jumped sharply.

There were a bunch of red roses in his drawer.

Xiao Chen’s hand trembled a little as he held the red rose in his hand. His movements were light, as if he was worried about damaging its delicate flower.

He looked back at Zhou Ming, who was still immersed in his own world and turned around. He exhaled deeply, seemingly a little unsettled. 

This rose was still fresh. There were water droplets on the top of the branches. The broken branches were still green, and they hadn’t turned yellow. There was even a faint fragrance. Xiao Chen used his hand to squeeze the petals; they were still hard.

He was utterly certain that this bouquet of flowers had not been placed here for too long.

Xiao Chen’s eyes were sharp, and he noticed that there was a card in the drawer. He reached out and gently picked it up, and when he could see the words on it clearly, he couldn’t help but freeze.

‘There may be five thousand flowers exactly like you in the world, but only you are my unique rose.’ — ‘The Little Prince.’ 

Who the hell is it?

Xiao Chen was horrified and had a series of questions in his mind.

–

Wang Yeze began to recall the key characters in his head, trying to find clues. 

In this movie, there were a total of eight actors, three girls and five boys.

Li Da, Zhou Ming, Xiao Chen, Wang Yeze, Yang Sun, Wang Jingyi, Luo Xiaoxiao, and Jiang Ling.

Excluding himself, there were still seven people left. Excluding the boys, there were only three left. Now that Wang Jingyi was dead, that left only Luo Xiaoxiao and Jiang Ling as his target mission.

As long as he killed these two, his mission would be complete! 

Thinking of this, Wang Yeze hooked the corners of his mouth. Not knowing what little plan he had in mind, he narrowed his eyes, looking like he was bound to win.




“Xiaoxiao, are you going to eat?” The girl with braids pushed Luo Xiaoxiao with her left hand. She had her head down and played with her phone in her right hand, looking like she was probably chatting with someone else. 

Luo Xiaoxiao’s expression is a bit dull, and her eyes are a bit empty. She sat dumbly in the chair and stayed in the same position for almost half an hour. Usually, she would get up early in the morning to clean up because of her love of beauty.

However, surprisingly, she did not wear any makeup or even lipstick. Her hair was also a mess, which made her look as if she was ten years older.

The moment the girl pushed her, she was so shocked that she stood up from her chair. Her movements were so fierce that she startled the girl who pushed her.

“I’m going, Xiaoxiao. Are you okay? What’s wrong with you today? You look like you’re in a state of shock.” The girl said, intending to touch Luo Xiaoxiao’s shoulder. The latter’s pupils contracted sharply, and she subconsciously covered her face with her hand as if she didn’t want to be seen like this at all. 

The girl frowned as she saw this, her face turned to the side, looking a little ugly for a moment, and her eyebrows furrowed.

Luo Xiaoxiao just reacted as if there was something dirty on her phone. Thinking of this, her face became a bit ugly as well. She curled her lips and snorted with discontent and angrily said, “If you don’t want to go, then don’t go. What kind of attitude is that? You’re sick!”

After that, she turned around without looking at Luo Xiaoxiao’s face, which was actually pale to the point of exhaustion. She rushed towards the door, her small leather shoes making an unpleasant sound as they stepped on the floor. When she reached the door, she even intentionally pushed the door hard to make a loud noise.

Only Luo Xiaoxiao remained in place.

Luo Xiaoxiao moved her lips; her entire face was bloodless, and her lips were pale. She stiffly turned her head and looked in the direction the girl left with her hands shaking a bit. Her legs went limp, and she fell right to her knees as if she was a lost soul.

After leaving, the more the girl thought about it, the angrier she became. Her eyebrows furrowed together, the fingers of her right hand tightly squeezed the phone, and her expression was somewhat twisted.

She admits that she was usually relatively close to Luo Xiaoxiao, living in the same dorm room and often going to dinner together. But in reality, she also had to admit that she envied Luo Xiaoxiao and was intensely jealous of her at the same time.

Luo Xiaoxiao was the flower of their department. She was good looking, her grades were among the best, and her family was also very good. Many people were chasing after her, not only in their own department but also in other departments. Even in other schools, people were showing her affection. 

The girl kicked her toes, and the more she thought about it, the more it was unpleasant, and the more the sour taste simply couldn’t stop coming out.

To tell the truth, it was evident that she was not bad looking and was otherwise considered a standout as well. Still, when she walked with Luo Xiaoxiao, anyone would only notice Luo Xiaoxiao and not herself because Luo Xiaoxiao had a unique temperament that was eye-catching as she walked.

This made her prideful and competitive heart secretly dissatisfied. She felt that Luo Xiaoxiao was just a flower vase, which was not as good as herself.

It was unclear if she was so engrossed in her thoughts that she kept her head down and focused on curling her toes, but she didn’t even notice that she was coming up against a tall boy. The two of them bumped right into each other. 

“Classmate, are you okay?” The boy stopped soon after the collision and pulled the girl, asking softly in a very concerned voice.

The girl was stunned as if she didn’t expect the other to be such a gentleman. Her cheeks were a little red; she fidgeted and stammered, “No, it’s fine.”

With hard features, this guy was handsome, the kind of looks that ordinary girls liked the most. He was not greasy, but very fresh and dressed simply, with a plain white t-shirt and sneakers.

Wang Yeze’s mouth slyly turned upward. He smiled and stepped forward to help the person up. His two eyes were like a swirling vortex capable of sucking the person in. 

He grabbed the girl’s hand so that the latter was forced to look at him and then stared intently into her eyes with his own.

The latter’s expression slowly diminished at speed visible to the naked eye, and the light that used to shine in her eyes began to disappear. Her eyes became hollow, and her entire body became stuck like a program that had been disconnected. Her whole body paused in place, like a soulless person.

Wang Yeze saw the situation and hooked the corners of his mouth. His voice was obviously plain but compelling as he stared at the girl closely and hypnotized, “Next, you must do as I say.”

The girl paused, her arms and legs were stiff, and she nodded dumbly, like a puppet. 

Wang Yeze’s heart was tingling with joy at the sight of this. He was somewhat proud of himself, not expecting that this golden finger the system had prepared for him was quite useful.

Although the number of times he could use it wasn’t much, it was better than nothing at all.

Thinking of this, Wang Yeze curled his lips and could not help but start calling out to the system in his heart, with a bit of pride, ‘Hey, system, are you there?’

No one picked up the conversation. 

Wang Yeze wasn’t annoyed this time because the system had been offline several times recently. Still, each time it was harmless, so he didn’t take it seriously.

But he forgot that his only connection to this world and the original world was through the system. If the system wasn’t online five out of ten times, the situation was already so serious that his personal safety, all his guarantees, had been reduced to nothing.

Perhaps there would be no way to escape at any time when the crisis came.

Xiao Chen paused in his dorm room, and, not knowing what came to mind, he opened the school’s posting as if he had a sense of some sort. 

As he had expected, the hot posts on the school’s posting bar were related to the two recent murders.

Xiao Chen held up his glasses; the bridge of his nose was very straight. He slid his hand over the screen of his phone in a somewhat contemplative manner, turning the pages of the posts and slowly moving them down.

Suddenly, his hand faltered, and his attention was drawn to a post that had been published long ago but was coming up on top of the highlights.

The post’s name is: Let’s Talk About That Wishing Tree at School, You Don’t Have to Look to Know, You’ll Be Surprised. 

1L: International practice, the first floor is the landlord, and the second floor talks about the matter.

2L: As you should know, the history of our school is not too long, not even ten years. And the land of our school is also different from other schools. It’s not some kind of longevity mountain or a mass grave. This place was formerly a relatively high-class hospital.

This hospital went bankrupt due to a raging fire back then. It is said that quite a few people died because of the fire, I’m not sure about the specifics, but the number was definitely not less than three digits. The hospital was also burdened with a huge amount of compensation.

Oh, and someone might have to ask at this point what this has to do with the Wishing Tree. 

Do you know how long the Wishing Tree has been living? The landlord has a friend in this area who has observed this tree, from the tree trunk, branches, bark, and so on, to analyze and concluded that this tree is probably a hundred years old.

Speaking of which, still don’t get it?

The fire back then, not to mention the people, the plants, and everything else couldn’t have survived! But this Wishing Tree had actually survived to this day?

OK, at this time, some people may say that the greenery in the school is transplanted from another place, and this Wishing Tree might be too. 

The landlord doesn’t have much to say about this, so let’s go straight to the picture.

【Photo】

3L: And the magical thing about the Wishing Tree is much more than just that it survived the fire.

The Wishing Tree is very robust, entirely as big as any other tree. Still, the strange thing is that all year round, his branches and leaves are yellow, like a frozen season, and won’t grow at all. 

This is one of the strange points.

I’m sure you’ve heard many school legends about the Wishing Tree, such as stories about people worshipping the tree in the middle of the night and about old women turning into young girls.

While all of this is yet to be proven, these campus rumors actually cast a mysterious light on the Wishing Tree.

We also call it the Wishing Tree because of the unknown grade year that started hanging red strips of cloth with wishes written on them on the tree trunk. Slowly, more and more people did so, turning the tree into a school landmark. 

Xiao Chen clicked on the picture, his throat moved. His nerves were stimulated, and his eyes were a bit moist.

This picture was an old photo taken with a mobile phone. It could be seen that this photo was already several years old, and the side was even a little yellowish.

The content of the picture is also very simple.

A window, a tree, and you can still see the incredibly large telephone pole in the distance. And the angle of the photo is a little strange, the photographer was inside the house, not outside, and there’s a sense of confined beauty to it. 

However, it is unknown if the photo has been smashed or not, but it is all wrinkled. It can be seen that the later keeper had restored it to make the picture as flat as possible.

Xiao Chen didn’t know what he had thought of, but he suddenly raised the phone to the wall, maintaining a position to look at the picture.

Xiao Chen’s eyes were fiery and a bit stiff. He backed up, his fingers crossing the screen of the phone, and his arms shook. He hurriedly withdrew the phone and exhaled a breath.

The angle of this photo…… 

Has he ever been to this place?

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen felt a stabbing pain in his head, and whatever thought that had originally emerged was interrupted by this pain. He had to hold his hand on his temple position and gasp.

The boy looked out of the window. He poked his finger at the glass, blinked in boredom, and didn’t know what to think. His small head turned to look at the teenager sitting on the sofa, quietly reading a book. The teenager was wearing a hospital gown, and the wide collar exposed his collarbone. The teenager’s frame was very slender and gave people a sense of sickly beauty.

Perhaps the boy’s gaze was too direct, but the teenager put down the book he was holding, locked eyes with him, beckoned, and said softly, “Come, sit next to me.” 

It was also because the teenager looked so soft and weak, making the wound on his right hand that was bandaged very obvious and hard to ignore. There was still blood on the gauze, and you could tell that a finger was missing from that area of the wound.

The boy rushed over obediently and climbed slowly onto the couch. He stomped his short legs and wiggled his little feet. Suddenly, he pointed out the window and said innocently, “Why don’t you ever go out?”

Every time he comes inside to play with him.

The youth didn’t get angry at his innocent words, but his eyes became a little darker, and he didn’t know what to think about. After the boy stared at his face for almost two minutes, the youth couldn’t help but laugh and said, “Do you know about the Ivory Tower?” 

The boy shook his head honestly.

The young man continued, “The Ivory Tower speaks of a dream realm beyond the real world, away from life.” He paused, the corners of his eyes rising, “This room is my Ivory Tower.”

The boy, with a muddled face, thought for a moment and said, “It’s like Rapunzel, right?”

Rapunzel, a girl who was locked up in a tower by a witch, and enjoyed her solitude. She fell in love with a prince and was left alone in the wilderness by the witch. 

The young man smiled again at the words and just touched the boy’s head.

Wrong, it was only half right.

Everyone says that the Ivory Tower is good. It was only simple and pure, but how can anyone in this world keep living in the Ivory Tower, where he is locked up and deprived of the freedom that everyone else should enjoy.

Because he is sick. 

He likes to hurt himself when he gets ill, and even the doctors wonder if he has a violent personality.

He is locked in this room. Even though nothing is missing from this room, there is no life at all, and all he can see of the world is the view through the glass. Like a frog in a well, he has no idea of the size of the world.

No one speaks to him. Even the doctors and nurses who change his medication subconsciously avoid him and talking to him. Otherwise, their words are filled with caution.

The young man’s expression became dark, but the next moment the boy grabbed the wounded hand, and he looked down at the boy. The boy’s small face crumpled into a ball. Somewhat distressed, he blew air on his hand at the wound and said, “I’ll blow on it, and it won’t hurt.” 

The youth moved his mouth at the news, his expression stunned for a moment. He even allowed the boy to grab his hand and play with it at will.

Suddenly, as the teenager stared at the boy’s round, puffy face and looked at his serious expression with hidden distress, he couldn’t help but laugh.

So then what happened?

Later on, the story is that the prince who lived in the ivory tower met the little boy who accidentally entered the ivory tower. From then on, the world, which is only black and white, became more and more colorful for him. 

He is convinced that the prince and the boy will always be together.

Rapunzel has also gone through many hardships to live with her beloved prince, have children, and live happily ever after.



Xiao Chen’s dull eyes slowly focused, and his whole body became slightly more colorful. He gradually came to his senses, moved his lips, and softly called out, “Su Yan?” 

Something in the air seemed to have frozen.

Xiao Chen swallowed his saliva, and his Adam’s apple moved. He bobbed his head and patted his face with his palm.

He didn’t even seem to notice that he had just uttered a name for no reason at all.

Xiao Chen’s fingers lightly passed over the screen of the phone. He didn’t say anything but was in deep thought. 

There were a lot of people online lately. People would start posting from time to time, and it could be turned into a high-rise building easily.

This may be related to the fact that the school has not been peaceful lately.

Xiao Chen’s fingers faintly paused as a title of a post caught his attention. Xiao Chen frowned and subconsciously looked back at Zhou Ming, who was behind him. It was unknown when Zhou Ming put down the game console, but he, who rarely used the computer, turned it on and tapped his hands on the keyboard.

Xiao Chen withdrew his gaze and continued to read the post. The post’s name is: What kind of person is the department flower of the School of Journalism and Communication in private, do you know?

Xiao Chen was aware of this person; this girl was Luo Xiaoxiao. Zhou Ming had been chasing the goddess since high school.

He had followed Zhou Ming to meet her twice, and she was really good looking.

In fact, Zhou Ming looks quite good. Although his character is more playful and cynical, he is very serious in terms of relationships. If someone chases him, he won’t hang around, and he’ll make a quick decision. Not to mention that when he meets someone he likes, he can’t wait for the world to know. Supposedly back then, he was at the tail end of his class. To catch up with Luo Xiaoxiao, he studied and worked hard day and night to get into the same university as his goddess. The final results were quite impressive, but it wasn’t enough. Even though he was a little short of the university admission line, he quickly asked someone to buy his way into the place.

Therefore, as soon as Xiao Chen saw this post, he cast his gaze at Zhou Ming. 

Xiao Chen looked at this post, his hand slightly paused, and finally clicked on it.

Xiao Chen flipped through the post roughly, reading the general content of the post. After reading it, he really couldn’t help but frown.

The content of the post was somewhat overwhelming.

The post thoroughly described Luo Xiaoxiao as a backstabbing wh*re, describing in graphic detail how she privately hooked up with those men and how she benefited from them. 

How usually unreasonable and arrogant she was, and how she privately ridiculed the boys who chased her. It even posted a bunch of chat records.

Of course, what made Xiao Chen couldn’t help but frown the most was that Zhou Ming was mentioned in this post.

Zhou Ming is the most special of all Luo Xiaoxiao’s suitors. He’s so in love with her that almost everyone knows he’s cut off all his love affairs for her.

This post addresses all of these things. First, it describes Zhou Ming as a love-struck man in a long, drawn-out article. It then belittles Luo Xiaoxiao’s lack of interest in Zhou Ming and her mocking of him behind his back. 

Looking at it roughly, it would really feel like a goddess falling off the pedestal.

But let’s be honest, this kind of post, one without substantial impactful photos, and with little supporting evidence, except for the chat records, which can be fabricated proof, is not at all credible.

But you have to understand that people are creatures with a predatory mind who like to see heroes fall from grace. When they are given a reason to attack those who are good, they just swarm up as righteous ambassadors, not caring whether things are real or not.

After all, there was no cost for spreading rumors. All it took was a mouth. 

Xiao Chen’s expression grew heavier and heavier. He flipped through the posts again. The content of the following posts even began to use Luo Xiaoxiao to write unsightly articles. A group of people then began to belittle and mock her.

It was really hard to imagine how a group of people could have such great malice towards a girl.

Xiao Chen was thinking, and before he could turn the page, this post had actually been deleted by the system.

Xiao Chen was first stunned and then looked back at Zhou Ming. 

Zhou Ming’s expression was grave, even ugly, while his fingers kept tapping on the keyboard.

Xiao Chen had guessed it!

This post was deleted by Zhou Ming.

Zhou Ming only could not calm down at all on the matter of Luo Xiaoxiao. 

Zhou Ming ignored Xiao Chen’s gaze, but he looked a little anxious. When he finished getting everything done, he shut down the computer. Then, without saying anything, he walked straight out the door without even putting on his shoes. His steps were very eager and looked a bit of a mess.

Xiao Chen looked at his back thoughtfully and stayed there.

Retracting his gaze, he continued to be in a daze.

Xiao Chen stayed in his chair, staring out of the window at the scenery. He didn’t know what he was thinking about, but he gently took out the bunch of roses that had mysteriously appeared from his drawer and stared at it. 

Red roses…

Little rose…

Suddenly, with a jolt, his eyes, which had been dull, snapped awake. He sprang to his feet. His chair made a creaking and squeaking sound as he moved dramatically.

He looked around, and something seemed to pop into his head. He abruptly started running for the door as if summoned by some sort of soul bond. 

He ran so hard that his heartbeat was incredibly fast.

It was probably because he was in too much of a hurry that quite a few people were looking off to him along the way. But it was as if he didn’t see the looks the rest of them were giving him and didn’t care.

At this moment, he only had one thought in his head!

The wind slowly blew against the leaves, making a rustling sound. 

The sun was quite fierce, and it wasn’t too comfortable to be out under it. The leaves were against the sunlight, spreading a halo of light that hit the ground.

Xiao Chen’s footsteps stopped, and he paused in place. He still clutched the flower in his hand, and he was still panting, and his forehead was covered with sweat beads because he had just run too fast.

His hand holding the flower was covered in dense sweat, and if you looked closely, you could also notice that his hand was shaking a little.

As usual, there were very few people coming to the library. Especially after Wang Jinyi’s murder, there were hardly any students coming here. 

Xiao Chen looked at the Wishing Tree from a distance with a somewhat numb expression. He stepped forward step by step, like a young man who was trying to get a date with his beloved while still clutching the flowers in his hand.

“Su Yan?” Xiao Chen’s expression somewhat moved. He pursed his lips, and his gaze fell on the tree in front of him.

The wind blew up the bangs on his face, and the eyes hidden in the frame of the glasses were revealed.

And these eyes were beautiful, with tears in them, like stars. 

“Su Yan? Is that you?”

It’s you. Are you back?

—— I’ve waited too long! I’ve been waiting for you! 

If you leave again, I really don’t know how many more crazy things I’ll do.

Because you’re the only medicine to stop me from getting sick. 

If you don’t stay with me, I’m nothing but a rabid dog who bites at everyone I see.

“Did the autopsy results come out?” The woman’s expression was serious as her fingers tapped on the table. 

The male police officer who was next to her immediately handed the report that had just been sent over to the woman.

The woman’s name was Zhou Yingmei. She had been a police officer for more than a decade, but she had never encountered such a strange case since she started her career.

It was understood that Wang Jingyi had many unexplained aspects before her death. Her personality had changed somewhat drastically. If it weren’t for the fact that there couldn’t possibly be any gods or monsters in this world, she really would have to wonder if this person’s core had changed.

Putting aside her personality for the moment, it was also confirmed that her intelligence had dropped far too much. It wasn’t as if she (ZY) hadn’t met girls who were devastated by their love affairs, but she hadn’t seen anything like this. 

Zhou Yingmei flipped through the autopsy report, her expression growing increasingly severe.

When they first recovered the body, they had also wondered if it was a suicide. As they accessed the CCTV, there was only one monitor over the pool, but the location was not pointed where Wang Jingyi was found dead. Still, it could basically be ruled out that someone else had walked nearby that night.

But after further delving into the investigation, they realized that it wasn’t that simple.

There was no water in the deceased’s lungs. The lobe of the deceased’s lungs did not sink even when placed in the water, which basically rules out the possibility that the deceased drowned. 

As Zhou Yingmei flipped through the autopsy report, her face crumpled into a ball.

As it turned out, the real cause was a sudden death due to myocardial infarction.

According to Wang Jingyi’s roommates, since Li Da’s death, Wang Jingyi was a bit distracted. For a while, she even looked like a different person. Her whole body was aging rapidly, but for some reason, she returned to her teenage self overnight. From this day on, Wang Jingyi’s grades jumped off a cliff.

The woman narrowed her eyes at the autopsy report. She then said to the male officer, “Go find out where Wang Jingyi was on the day that Li Da died.” 

Li Da and Wang Jingyi’s death. She had an inexplicable intuition that the two were definitely related.

This was her intuition as a woman as well after being a police officer for so many years.

This is precisely the kind of sixth sense that got her to where she is now.

– 

Yang Sun has been sitting cross-legged in front of the computer with instant noodles in his arms. He was half-naked, his hair was a little oily, there was still soup on his face from the instant noodles. His eyes were covered in black and blue as he had been in front of the computer for days. He looked both greasy and a little sloppy.

Messenger of Justice: Oh my, Luo Xiaoxiao is actually such a wh*re. I didn’t expect that the usually seemingly high and mighty actually play so openly in private. I wonder what it’s like to sleep together once.

Yang Sun scratched his head and picked at the residue in his teeth with his fingers. Then, he continued to post some obscenities under the post.

“Che, pretending to be noble in front of Lao Zi. It’s still just a thing that sleeps with people.” Yang Sun snorted as his fingers struck the keyboard violently. As if Luo Xiaoxiao had killed his entire family, he stirred up and cursed underneath the post with great passion. 

Looking at the comments that gave him praise that even covered tall buildings, he hooked his lips. He picked his nose before continuing with his long speech.

Before he could send the text out, the page actually directly crashed!

“F*ck.” Yang Sun didn’t hold back and directly cursed out, his stomach instantly filled with anger.

He exited the page, only to find that the post had just been deleted! 

“Heh, this young master hasn’t even scolded with pleasure yet.” How could Yang Sun just let go of such an opportunity to insult Luo Xiaoxiao? The resentment from when his confession was rejected last time has been accumulating here.

Yang Sun decided to re-open a post and continue to build a tall building, bringing in the netizens who had just replied to him passionately. It was a fun thing to humiliate Luo Xiaoxiao.

Heh, got you, fake nobility.

—— Did you know that internet spewers are creatures who are clearly dark inside but like to consider themselves to be noble and attack others from the high ground of reason.




“Hey, is Luo Xiaoxiao hiding inside her dorm room, not daring to come out to meet anyone at all.” Girls this age just love to gossip. 

“Haha, who knows,” another girl chimed in, “Maybe she’s hiding in her room crying.”

“By the way, who do you think wrote that post?” the girl lowered her voice deliberately.

They paused in silence for a second, and then the air seemed to come to a standstill.

Finally, the other one, cautiously, whispered, “I think that person is Jiang Ling.” 

Luo Xiaoxiao buried her head in the pillow. Her body was shaking, her face devoid of color, even her breathing rate was slow. Like a puppet with a broken string, Luo Xiaoxiao had barely any life left in her.

She swallowed her saliva and buried her head even lower when she heard the small sounds of discussion outside the door.

Her cell phone, which she had left aside, was ringing continuously like it was infected with a virus, as if someone had been sending her messages.

With a cold face, Zhou Ming did not say anything and directly rushed to the girls’ dormitory. The dormitory aunt, who was guarding the door, could not help but stop him, “Eh eh eh, young man, this is the girls’ dormitory. Boys are not allowed to enter.”

Zhou Ming took one look at her and quickened his pace, unexpectedly rushing up without a word. Even the dormitory aunt urgently rushed up to pull him, but she couldn’t grab the other’s clothes.

Recently, several significant events have happened in the school, and everyone is on edge. Usually, if a boy enters the girls’ dormitory, she may turn a blind eye and let it pass, but now, in such an emergency, they have already had a meeting. They must take precautions, and the management must be rigorous. Even at night, they have to check the dormitory to make sure everyone is there.

Some students are not even bothered to stop him at this critical moment. The situation is simply very serious. 

Thinking of this, the aunt hurriedly ran back to her room, intending to contact the security personnel. 

Zhou Ming clenched his hands into fists and walked forward with a clear objective. All the girls who passed by looked at him with horrified faces, but he couldn’t care less now. He had to find Luo Xiaoxiao at the first opportunity.

Zhou Ming looked for Luo Xiaoxiao’s dorm room from memory and went off as if someone owed him eight million dollars.

“Bang bang.” Someone was knocking on the door.

Luo Xiaoxiao shuddered and buried her head deeper as if hypnotizing herself to not hear the sounds outside. 

“Bang bang.” The knocking on the door grew louder and louder. The person knocking on the door didn’t stop his hand from knocking on the door even though no one answered the door.

Luo Xiaoxiao’s breathing was labored. She sat up and pulled the blanket over her head, frantically paralyzing herself. 

Zhou Ming couldn’t wait any longer and shouted, “Xiaoxiao, I know you’re in there, open the door.”

Luo Xiaoxiao paused and stuck her head out. 

The man continued, “I’m Zhou Ming, Xiaoxiao, open the door.”

Luo Xiaoxiao heard the words and moved out of the blanket. She was about to open the door when she remembered the content of that post that had gone viral in the school. For a moment, her movements stopped again, and she hesitated a bit.

But the sound of her turning over just now had been clearly heard by the man outside, and Zhou Ming continued to shout, “Xiaoxiao, don’t be afraid, I’ll help you!” He paused and swore earnestly, ” Trust me, okay.”

Luo Xiaoxiao still didn’t open the door. 

She simply didn’t have the face to confront Zhou Ming, even if she knew that the post’s content was all fake. Even she, the person involved, felt ashamed when she read it, so who would believe her?

Zhou Ming looked like he still wanted to say something, but it was too late as the dormitory aunt had already rushed over with someone. Zhou Ming saw the situation and had no choice but to stop. He reluctantly continued, “Xiaoxiao, don’t be afraid, I’ll protect you! You wait for me! I’ll still come over to find you.”

With that said, Zhou Ming began to run away in the other direction to escape from the dormitory aunt.

Luo Xiaoxiao collapsed on the floor and began to sob silently. 

–

Wang Yeze shook his head and held his phone to see the direction of the posting. As expected, Luo Xiaoxiao’s related posts have overshadowed even those of Wang Jingyi and Li Da. A whole bunch of them have even popped up, and the vast number of enthusiastic netizens have provided a lot of explosive materials.

He quirked his lips and chuckled.

When the time comes to check based on the ID address, it won’t even trace back to him. 

All of this was done by a girl called Jiang Ling. Even if the time comes to clarify, the damage has already been done. As the saying goes, good things don’t go out, but bad things spread for a thousand miles. So even if someone comes out to dispel the rumors, Luo Xiaoxiao’s image has been deeply rooted in people’s hearts. Even if she didn’t do it, so what? People will still use it as a topic to talk about.

He just needed to find another time to hypnotize Luo Xiaoxiao and make her kill herself so everyone would point their fingers at the internet violence, at the person who had spoken up in the first place.

He just needs to go along with it, expose the truth, and blame it on Jiang Ling. Then, the next person to be subjected to violence will be her. At this point, Jiang Ling will also choose to commit suicide, which is both logical and reasonable.

Well, who would be blamed for this? 

Everyone would be a murderer. Everyone is involved.

Who is nobler than who?

–

The boy sat at the foot of the tree. The wind was slowly blowing in and ruffling the corners of his coat. 

He lifted his head and looked at the tree with his palm attached to the bark. Thinking of what Su Yan had told him, he couldn’t help but mutter, “Can trees really talk?”

“Hmm.” 

The boy was surprised as if he had just heard something. He sat up and started looking to his left and right for the source of the noise, but he didn’t see it, so he sat back down, feeling a little strange.

He tried to touch the bark again and asked cautiously, “Was that you talking just now?” 

“Hmm.” 

The boy was wide-eyed in disbelief, “So trees really can talk.”

But this time, the tree didn’t reply to him again.

The boy was a little lost and continued to squat on the ground, staring at the window in front of him. 

Su Yan was sick again today, and he couldn’t go play with him again.

–

Xiao Chen opened his eyes and subconsciously used his hand to block his eyes.

It was surprisingly dark, and he was even more unaware of when he had fallen asleep against the tree. 

He squinted his eyes, somewhat unable to see the scene in front of him. He touched the trunk of the tree and then crawled up in a muddle.

So dark.

Where were his glasses? Where did the glasses go? 

Xiao Chen touched the surroundings with his hand. He carefully squatted down, attached his hand to the soil, and began to feel around. 

Xiao Chen felt his brain somewhat rising, and his heart even more so. He felt an unexplainable sense of loss.

Did he forget something again?

Without his glasses, Xiao Chen was like a blind man. Especially at night with no lights, he couldn’t see the scene around him. He gulped a bit nervously.

How come there were no lights here at night. 

Before Xiao Chen could figure out how to get back, he suddenly felt what seemed like a pair of cold hands grabbing his right hand, and he shivered in fright.

“Don’t be afraid.” A faint voice sounded in his ears.

Xiao Chen froze. He didn’t feel afraid this time but instead had an inexplicable sense of familiarity. He would unconsciously relax his body.

Xiao Chen moved his mouth but didn’t speak. 

The man took his hand. With half an arm around his waist, the man led him in an unknown direction.

Xiao Chen swallowed his saliva. For some reason, he subconsciously trusted the man very much, even knowing that he wouldn’t hurt himself at all.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen chose to obey his heart and took the initiative to ask in a small voice, “You, are you my illusion?”

The man was stunned and then laughed out lightly, gripping Xiao Chen’s hand tighter, “No.” 

Xiao Chen hesitated for a moment, and as if something flashed in his head, he asked somewhat weakly, “Then, are you Su Yan?”

The man paused, and Xiao Chen could even feel the other man stop in his tracks because of his words. There was some silence in the air, and finally, he heard the man say back, “You remember.”

Xiao Chen frowned and gently shook his head.

He only recalled a few vague fragments, but it wasn’t enough to piece together a complete memory. In his dream, the only thing he remembered most profoundly was the word Su Yan. 

Xiao Chen lowered his eyes.

Su Yan was an existence that was beyond words to him.

Su Yan chuckled and attached his right hand to Xiao Chen’s head, with a bit of affection as if he was comforting his emotions. And this feeling of touching his head was very familiar to Xiao Chen, as if someone had done it to him countless times before.

Meanwhile, Xiao Chen blurted out and asked, “Your hand is fine.” 

After that, both of them were stunned.

The little finger of Su Yan’s right hand moved, and Xiao Chen couldn’t see that there was actually a very obvious scar at his little finger’s location.

As a result, Su Yan’s voice was covered in a bit of complication and magnetic huskiness, “One day, you’ll remember.”

Su Yan held Xiao Chen’s waist and moved slowly in the silent night. 

Xiao Chen felt that the surroundings were a little too quiet as he could even hear the sound of his heartbeat and breathing.

Su Yan was like a ghost, making no sound whatsoever. If it weren’t for the fact that he held on tightly to his hand, he would have almost wondered if Su Yan actually existed or not.

It was unknown how long he had been walking, but Xiao Chen faintly saw the light in the distance.

Su Yan stopped in his tracks and let go of Xiao Chen’s hand, but Xiao Chen subconsciously went to grab him. 

Su Yan laughed and took the opportunity of Xiao Chen’s lack of attention to put something directly on Xiao Chen’s face.

It was his glasses.

Xiao Chen heard him softly say, “Next time, don’t lose them.”

And don’t lose me again. 

Someday, you’ll remember.

It’s not just that part of the memory you lost. 

There are also countless memories that we walked through together.

Su Yan raised his eyes and looked at Xiao Chen, who was still a little dazed. He brushed the other’s bangs with his hand. Underneath the bangs were a pair of amorous phoenix eyes, which shined like stars in the night. 

Su Yan’s gaze rested on the pendant hanging from Xiao Chen.

He attached his hand to the pendant.

Wait a little longer. I will definitely, definitely take you away from this place.




The sky slowly darkened. In the summer, night always falls quickly, and soon the whole sky becomes pitch black, and the night envelops the entire world endlessly. 

The wind chimes hanging from the tree branches were blown by the wind, creating a crisp sound that sounded a bit eerie in this silent and spooky night.

“Let’s go.” A girl’s voice came from afar. Her voice was small and shaky, sounding a little scared.

She thought that boys were terrible, going on dates in places like this.

“What are you afraid of? I’m here.” The boy scoffed and was not too concerned. 

“But there have been two murders in the school recently. Not many people dare to come here to the library during the day, let alone at night.” The girl was still a little scared, her voice getting even quieter. Even her breathing seemed to become a bit short due to the tension.

The boy didn’t pay much attention to it and even deliberately or accidentally waved his hand over the girl’s body, causing her to back away from him.

“Don’t do that,” the girl’s voice changed tone, and she even let out a shy laugh.

The red ribbon hanging on the tree was blown by the fine wind, swaying around and making a whirring sound.

“Bang.” Something huge and heavy fell to the ground, sending out a loud bang like a bright comet falling to earth, shaking the whole land.

“Ahhhhh!” The girl’s entire body trembled with a jolt and directly collapsed to the ground.

She had just seen a shadow fall from the sky!

The boy’s hand that had been fumbling around on the girl’s body also drew back in shock from the loud noise that came from the sky. His entire body also lay on the ground because of the girl’s power. 

“Thump, thump,” They were positioned so close together that both could clearly hear the other’s rapid heartbeat.

The girl’s legs were a little soft.

The boy’s self-esteem was high, so despite the frightened heart about to jump out, he still had to stand up forcefully and calmly. The girl looked at him with a scared look and nervously grabbed the corner of the other’s coat in a shaky voice, “What do we do?”

Her face was white, and her body was all shaking from anxiety. 

The boy wasn’t much better than her. He gulped, his eyelids kept fluttering, and his legs were a little weak.

The girl’s gaze was still fixed on the boy as if she was waiting for him to make a move.

The boy forced a smile and helped the girl to her feet; cold sweat left his head. Finally, he faltered at the girl’s stare and said helplessly, “How about, how about we walk over there.”

The girl shook her head violently at the words. She was a little scared out of her wits, but she finally said with a cry, “Okay, okay.” 

The two of them were like conjoined twins, taking every step carefully. Even the clicking sound they made when they stepped on the grass would make them panic as if they were facing an enemy.

The black mass was some distance away from the two of them.

The girl used the light of her phone’s flashlight and moved her body carefully step by step.

However, the light from the flashlight was too small to reach far, and the two could only shake their hands and keep flashing the light in front of them. 

It was near……

The two of them gulped subconsciously.

The part where the light hits was getting closer to the dark thing.

The two paused. 

“Ahhhhhhh!” The girl held her head in her hands and screamed out frantically. Her legs seemed to be out of control, and she fell to her knees directly on the floor, her body shaking even more as she gasped for air.

Lying there was none other than a person.

A bloody corpse with the brains falling out!!

The girl’s lips were white as her throat moved. Her head was a little swollen, and she even got a little dizzy. 

She got a good look at the person’s face.

The girl swallowed her saliva.

It was Jiang Ling.

“Did you hear? Someone died again!” 

“Oh, God, I heard!” After a pause, the person whispered, “But I also heard that she committed suicide.”

“Eh! Stop it, you guys! There’s been so much going on at school lately! It’s a little creepy for me hearing about it!”

The sounds of gossip came in tiny bits and pieces from all around, in groups of three or two.

Wang Yeze’s teeth were clenched, and his eyebrows furrowed together. His expression was a bit fierce, and his ears were perked up as he eavesdropped on the whispers of the people around him. He couldn’t help but frown with every few lines of gossip he heard about Jiang Ling’s suicide. 

He had already gotten the news of Jiang Ling’s suicide the first time.

But this matter was too strange!

Luo Xiaoxiao is still alive. How could Jiang Ling commit suicide?

He didn’t even know what the reason was for Jiang Ling’s suicide. 

Thinking of this, he was a bit depressed, and his heart was even more agitated.

But he quickly consoled himself that whether it was Luo Xiaoxiao or Jiang Ling, who would die from these emotions, it would only be beneficial to him. Anyway, Jiang Ling would have had to die sooner or later, and now that she was dead, it would save him a lot of trouble.

As long as Luo Xiaoxiao died next, his mission would be complete.

Thinking like this, Wang Yeze relieved his frustration a little. He gave himself a small pep talk, and the hint of strangeness and even panic he felt about the matter was suppressed. 

It’s okay, no problem.

Wang Yeze comforted himself, patting his chest with his hand, and then his eyes turned stern and somewhat vicious.

Luo Xiaoxiao must die as soon as possible!

– 

Xiao Chen had been sitting at the library window for over an hour, propping his head up and looking out the window at the Wishing Tree.

The area around the entrance below had been cordoned off by the police. A human figure had been traced on the ground in white ash, and the tragic state of the deceased’s death could be faintly figured out.

There was no one outside. To be precise, there were no more than a handful of people in the library, no activity at all.

Zhou Ming was sitting beside Xiao Chen, playing with a game console in his hand as usual while his legs were crossed. 

Xiao Chen returned to his senses and rubbed his temples to relieve his fatigue.

With his glasses on, one couldn’t clearly see his expression beneath them.

Zhou Ming changed his posture and remained silent from the start to the end, holding a game console in his hand.

In fact, if Xiao Chen hadn’t been so distracted today, he should have noticed that there were many things wrong with Zhou Ming lately. Still, even if Xiao Chen had, he wouldn’t have taken it to heart. 

“Zhou Ming,” Xiao Chen suddenly spoke out, looking back at Zhou Ming.

Zhou Ming looked up, his hand playing the game stopped, “What?”

“Do you believe in ghosts and gods?” Xiao Chen’s expression was faint, not sure what he was thinking about.

Zhou Ming sneered, “No, I don’t believe.” 

Xiao Chen continued to ask, “Then what do you believe in.”

Zhou Ming’s hand paused, and he pursed his lips, looking a little secretive for a moment, “I believe in myself.”

Xiao Chen didn’t say anything, but Zhou Ming hooked his lips. His eyes glittered with an unknown light as he looked at Xiao Chen and asked in return, “Xiao Chen, do you know what the nature of the world is?”

Xiao Chen’s mind seemed to grasp something, but the strange feeling quickly disappeared from his mind. He paused, his eyes somewhat dim, and said truthfully, “I don’t know.” 

Zhou Ming didn’t look surprised at all to hear Xiao Chen’s answer. He just tilted his head, still looking careless, and shrugged his shoulders, “I also don’t know.”

The two of them quieted down in tacit agreement.

What was the nature of the world?

The place was a movie. 

–

The boy stood by the door with a gloomy face. He held a stool in his hand and smashed the door madly as if he was desperate for something. His eyes were wide open and bloodshot, and his expression was fierce.

“Where is he!!!” His voice was hoarse and was almost mute as if his voice had been broken from exertion.

“Where is he?” He slammed the stool down on the door. There were already numerous dips in the metal door, all of which were from being hit. 

Outside the door, the nurses were in chaos and gathered in a group to discuss measures.

The boy threw the stool to the ground with a loud bang.

He formed a fist and started smashing the door as if he couldn’t feel the pain. His hands were already bruised and blue, and even blood marks were produced. Still, he persevered and smashed the door like crazy.

“What should we do? This patient has another episode!” The nurse’s voice was trembling. 

Once this patient had an attack, he would go crazy. It had been a full five months since his last episode, and she had almost forgotten that this boy was ruthless enough to cut off even his own fingers!

Thinking of this, she was a bit stiff and frightened when she heard the loud ‘bang’ sound coming from the door.

The head nurse was the oldest but looked a bit flustered. She could only ask around, “Where’s that boy who often comes looking for him? Get him quick!”

There was no one here who didn’t know that the boy was the only medicine he had. 

There was a hurried voice in the corner that answered, “Have you forgotten that boy’s surgery failed today? He’s been taken to the morgue!”

The head nurse was frozen and was at a complete loss for words.

It was unclear if the boy had heard their conversation, but the smashing of the door was getting worse and worse, and he even started banging the door with his shoulder.

His voice was becoming increasingly maniacal and hoarse, “He is there!!!! Give him back to me now!” 

My baby’s gone. Do you know where he is?



Zhou Yingmei tapped her fingers on the table and had an unpleasant look. Her usually calm expression even showed anxiety that could not be concealed. 

There was a pile of materials related to the case on the table.

She has been staying up for several nights! Not only was the case unsolved, but at such a critical time, the school had a series of murders. Not only did the school’s leadership have a problem with them, but the higher-ups in the bureau also had complaints. Even in the city, the rumors had spread, causing panic.

At this point, she scratched her hair anxiously.

Zhou Yingmei pursed her lips, looked at the details of the case, and scowled slightly. 

She shook her head and couldn’t help the doubts that arose in her mind.

Whether it was Li Da’s death, Wang Jingyi’s death, or even Jiang Ling’s death, the information was clear when the case was first investigated. However, the strange thing was that the more the case was investigated, the clues that surfaced became more and more confusing, like a spider’s web that was randomly woven together. The more you looked into it, the more complicated it became. Some clues seemed like they were made up by someone who deliberately wanted them to be discovered.

However, these clues appeared abruptly. They made sense but were also puzzling.

When she thought of this, Zhou Yingmei’s expression became even more serious.

As a woman’s sixth sense, she somehow felt that there was some force majeure that kept steering these cases in the same direction.

And the scary thing was that some of these clues were strangely pointing to the same person.

Zhou Yingmei’s brows furrowed deeper, and that person’s face appeared in her head.

Xiao Chen. 

Zhou Yingmei shook her fist.

At the beginning of the investigation of Li Da’s case, their first targets were Li Da’s ex-girlfriends, including Wang Jingyi, all of whom were suspected by the police. However, before they could investigate all of them, they were led to investigate Xiao Chen’s case and his family affairs, and even his potential danger.

In Wang Jingyi’s case, Xiao Chen has no suspicion because the results of their investigation show that the two basically have no intersection. Still, at the time of Wang Jingyi’s death, Xiao Chen appeared near the library and was filmed by surveillance cameras.

Immediately afterward, the police started investigating Wang Jingyi’s communication tools and software. They found the chat logs between Xiao Chen and Wang Jingyi, which showed that Xiao Chen had ambiguous thoughts about Wang Jingyi and even sent some explicit messages. 

The common ground between Jiang Ling and Xiao Chen hasn’t surfaced yet, but Zhou Yingmei has this hunch that if the case continues to go on like this, Xiao Chen will definitely still be the object of suspicion.

And her sixth sense as a woman was always very accurate.

Night.

The wind blew and moved the treetops. The leaves clustered together, rubbing back and forth against each other. 

There were no stars tonight, much less the moon. When one looked up, it was dark and lifeless.

“Ding!” Xiao Chen’s fingers that were rapidly tapping on the keyboard stopped. The frame of his glasses covered his eyes. He moved his head, and his eyes fell to the table next to him, to his phone screen.

It was the sound that only rang when a message was sent.

Xiao Chen scowled, not rushing to pick the phone up. 

“Ding! Ding! Ding!” The messages sounded as if they were continuously bombarded.

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows furrowed even deeper.

Something was wrong.

He was quite isolated and rarely revealed his personal information. The communication software he used only added Zhou Ming as a friend. He entered one of their class groups, but he never sent messages to the class group and blocked them. 

Zhou Ming doesn’t use the software to contact him and usually just makes a phone call. Both of them are not the kind of people who are friendly and talkative.

When Xiao Chen thought of this, he was filled with doubts, and his heart felt a bit stuffy. He slowly picked up the phone and opened the screen. When he saw the content, his expression slightly wavered.

Zhou Qiqi from the “Socialism is Good” group chat initiates a group chat with you.

Zhou Qiqi: Eh! Do you really like Wang Jingyi? 

Zhou Qiqi: You didn’t kill Li Da, did you?

Xiao Chen’s fingers touched the screen. The further he scrolled down, the tighter his expression became.

What is this nonsense?

Li Kekou: 【Picture】【Picture】【Picture】 

Li Kekou: Is this really all from you?

Xiao Chen was shocked and clicked on the picture. When he saw what was in the picture, his fingers trembled slightly.

–

Yang Sun pinched his lips and scratched the beard on his chin. The bruises under his eyes were getting worse, and there were even several blotches underneath the bruises, giving him a hollowed-out and weak appearance. 

There were instant noodle containers and sticky toilet paper all over his desktop, and the corners of his desk were covered in mold.

He had one leg propped up on the chair and the other hanging down.

There was a computer and several gaming devices on the table, and his phone had its screen on.

Hmm? Xiao Chen? Another big melon to eat? 

Yang Sun scratched the back of his head and sneered. He slid his fingers across the screen, his eyes glued to the school’s posting page.

[Shocking material! The computer science student Xiao Chen is secretly in love with Wang Jingyi. On the night of Wang Jingyi’s death, there are photos proving that he was near the library! There are pictures!!!]

1L: No one has ever known that Xiao Chen is secretly in love with Wang Jingyi, right? The landlord heard it from someone in the know!

It’s unlikely that no one knows Wang Jingyi by now. After all, it was such a major murder case. 

In case you don’t know about Xiao Chen, I’ll start with a paragraph of his introduction.

Xiao Chen is the top student in the freshman year of the Computer Science Department. He scored near-perfect scores on several major exams since the beginning of the school year. I forgot to mention that at first, the school arranged for him to speak as a student representative, but he refused. He generally has zero social life and spends most of his time in the library reading books. He is a quiet man and has never been seen talking to a woman. Some people even say that he is a monk and is asexual. If someone hadn’t discovered his chats with Wang Jingyi, I would never have believed this matter’s credibility.

2L: [Picture] [Picture] 

Yang Sun took a mouthful of instant noodles and clicked on these screenshots of the chat logs. 

The screenshots were from Wang Jingyi’s perspective.

Chen: The white dress you’re wearing today looks great.

Little Star: ……

Chen: You only had a cup of porridge for breakfast today. Won’t you be hungry? 

Chen: Do you believe in constellations?

Chen: What did you choose for your PE class?

Chen: Do you have anyone you like?

Little Star: I’ve got a boyfriend! Stop texting me! 

3L: From the time shown on the screenshots, it can be seen that before Wang Jingyi’s affair with Li Da was exposed, Xiao Chen had been messaging with her one-sidedly, and his liking for her was undisguised, but Wang Jingyi was basically cold to him, with no response. After Wang Jingyi got together with Li Da, Xiao Chen never took the initiative to contact Wang Jingyi again, and his chats with Wang Jingyi came to an abrupt end.

4L: The landlord has to add that the following is the landlord’s own assumptions, with no real evidence. It’s just a reference, and you don’t have to agree with it.

On the day of Wang Jingyi’s death, the landlord is 100% sure that Xiao Chen appeared near the library many times. Even because of this, the landlord asked some of the students who went to the library on that day. They all can prove that, indeed, Xiao Chen appeared near the library on that day.

Yes, the landlord also needs to add that the day after Li Da’s death, Xiao Chen was called to the police station as a suspect and didn’t come back that night. Although I don’t know why the police suspected him, Xiao Chen is indeed very suspicious no matter how you look at it! 

34L Melon Eater: F*ck, Xiao Chen is a murderer with no escape! It’s so obvious!

42L Sha Diao Xiao Mei: What the heck, what else is there besides this ambiguous chat log? Even chat records can be faked, okay? The entire article is written by someone in the know? Do you have the ability to tell me who the person in the know is? Don’t just accept everything, OK?

56L Orange Marmalade: Damn, who the hell is Xiao Chen! Sh*t! I’m so curious! It feels like he’s just an idiot! Isn’t it too similar to a pervert?

Yang Sun put down the instant noodles in his hands, sneered, and jerked his sleeves as if he was ready to show off his skills. 

85L Messenger of Justice: Heh, it’s all written so clearly! Xiao Chen is a murderer. He can’t escape! It’s disgusting. Who else could it be but him? Looking at the chat logs, I can tell he must have been stalking Wang Jingyi. He’s a psychopath, and this kind of person should go to hell!

Yang Sun just clicked send. He has been around the bar for years and has a lot of fans. As soon as he sent out a comment, people quickly started responding to it.

Yang Sun was humming a little song as if he was brewing up words, waiting to continue his cursing.

Xiao Chen’s pupils contracted sharply as he read the screenshot of the chat log, his eyes filled with disbelief. 

He hadn’t sent these messages at all.

At this point, he didn’t know what he was thinking, but he subconsciously went through his contacts.

He only had one category, and the number of people added up to no more than ten.

When he clicked on it, his expression changed from confusion to horror at a rate visible to the naked eye. 

There was actually a strange female without a note on his friend list.

The screen name, Little Star……

And this person’s avatar is the same one as the one that the classmate just sent him!

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen’s hand paused and somewhat hesitantly clicked on the chatbox with her. 

When he clearly saw what was inside, he directly sucked in a breath of cold air and was instantly dumbfounded.

What’s going on! There is actually a chat history in his phone of himself sending messages to Wang Jingyi?

It’s no different from the screenshots!

Xiao Chen squeezed his fist, his throat hurt, and his eyes were a little dizzy. 

–

The man dressed in all black leaned back on the couch, and on his lap lay a boy in lion pajamas. The boy seemed young and looked to be at most twenty years old.

The man stared at the boy’s face with a torch-like gaze. He smiled slightly and held the boy tightly in his arms. He wrapped his slender hand around the boy’s neck and stopped at his collarbone, stroking the sickle necklace around him.

“Baby.” The man spoke with a husky voice. 

The boy raised his head in response, meeting the other’s gaze as if to ask him what was wrong.

The man’s eyes were deep, like unfathomable stars. He patted the boy’s back and said softly, “Remember, if you wake up one day and find that the whole world has changed, even if there’s evidence that you’ve done something you didn’t do, you must remember that it’s not that you’ve done anything wrong, but that the world has gone mad.”

But that’s okay. You just have to remember that I will protect you.

I swear it in the name of Death.



Is this world real? 

For the people of this world, this is real. But for us, it’s called confinement.

–

Yang Sun scratched his head, rolled his eyes, and stretched his lazy back.

The comment he had just left on the bar had already been answered by countless people, with mixed reactions. 

Reply 1L: Come on, it’s all just the landlord’s own assumptions. It’s not right for you to call people names like that.

Reply 2L: I really don’t understand it now. To follow the rumor is also to take legal responsibility. You people shouldn’t always follow the trend, a bunch of idiots.

Reply 3L: I thought this person’s tone was a little too aggressive but is it necessary to pick on him?

Reply 4L: I’m afraid the upstairs is an idiot. How many people has this guy scolded? If you don’t know, don’t feel sorry for him, he owes a lot to be cleaned up.

……

Yang Sun looked over the comments and sneered. His psychological quality is very strong as he has long been used to being blasted by people. His side business is to earn a little money as a navy. Any comments from netizens will not have any effect on people like him.

With that in mind, he picked up the Coke from the table, opened the can, and gulped it into his mouth. He was going to take a break and fight for another three hundred rounds.

“PENG”, the computer screen suddenly went black and even made a violent popping sound. Yang Sun was so shocked that his whole body bounced off the stool. He even tripped over the seat with his right leg. He staggered and fell to the ground with the stool. 

Yang Sun sucked in a breath of cold air and wrapped his hands around his right leg. His expression was grim, and his right leg began to twitch in pain.

“F*ck,” Yang Sun cursed under his breath.

No one from their dorm room was there today, and even if there was someone in the dorm room right now, no one would care if he lived or died. After all, he basically had zero interaction with anyone in the dorm room, and he didn’t even go to class.

In other words, he was just a freak. 

He was unclean, sloppy, and uncommunicative. He always kept his head down and was very gloomy.

The horror in Yang Sun’s eyes hadn’t faded away yet. He swallowed and managed to get up from the ground with difficulty.

What happened?

The computer screen flickered again, emitting a white light. It repeated twice, and Yang Sun’s veins popped up. The computer screen began to slowly repair itself. In less than ten seconds, the original black screen of the computer returned to its original state. Even the pages were still the same as they were when Yang Sun opened them. 

It was as if nothing had just happened.

Yang Sun paused and hesitated, taking a cautious step and leaning towards the computer.

He looked around twice, picked up the leftover drink bottle from a few days ago on the desktop, and poked the computer screen.

There was no reaction. Everything was fine. 

Yang Sun exhaled a sigh of relief. His heart was finally relaxed, and he couldn’t help but curse, “What a stupid computer! How long has it been used! It’s rotten like this!”

After that, he picked up the seat he had just tripped over and sat back down on it.

Before he could sit still, the normal computer screen started to twitch again. It actually started to manipulate itself uncontrollably, jumping directly from the initial posting page related to Xiao Chen to the private message page.

When Yang Sun saw this, his heart sank, and an ominous premonition rose. 

Stranger Message:

787422: Time: 15:25, Location: Dorm 404.

787422: Are you ready for the Devil’s punishment?

The black fonts were like broken mirrors, shattered into pieces, and put back together again. The scarlet red font grew larger and larger as if it were trying to break through the screen! 

Yang Sun’s hands trembled as he tried to get up and escape.

But he was horrified to discover that no matter how much he moved, he couldn’t sit up from the seat like his butt was glued to it.

“Oooooh.” Yang Sun wanted to scream but could only make an unpleasant muffled sound and could not scream at all.

The veins on Yang Sun’s hands and forehead were bulging, his eyes looked like they were about to burst out, and his expression was hideous. 

No, I don’t want to die!

Yang Sun struggled desperately. He was looking right at the computer, and could even clearly see the time displayed on the computer!!!!

15:22.

There were three minutes left!!! 

“Oooooh.” Yang Sun tried to kick his legs, but nothing could be done, and both of his eyes shed tears in anxiousness.

Someone help me!!!

Yang Sun’s eyes rolled back, his mouth started to foam, and his body convulsed violently. His fingers stayed in the air in a strange position, resembling a zombie; he was very stiff.

One minute…… 

Two minutes……

Three minutes……

The computer screen occupied by the scarlet font flickered and jumped back to the computer desktop.

The force that restrained Yang Sun slowly disappeared. His head swayed to the right, and with a “Duang” sound, he slid off the stool and fell to the ground……. 

Everything returned to silence again.

–

“Team Zhou, a senior detective will be sent from above to assist you in your investigation today.”

Zhou Yingmei tapped the fingers of her right hand on the table repeatedly. When she heard the words on the other end of the phone, her expression remained unchanged, but there was a coldness in her eyebrows that could not be concealed. 

This school actually had another case!

Sh*t!!!

How many days has it been? There was one murder after another.

The people above couldn’t hold back any longer! Even her ability to solve cases was beginning to be questioned. 

The school had suspended classes, so all students were confined to their dormitories and not allowed to go out. Everyone was panicked.

When she hung up the phone, Zhou Yingmei supported her head with her hand. Her expression was solemn, and her entire state was visibly haggard.

She contemplated in the same place for an unknown period with a grimace on her face before she finally sat up. She breathed out a sigh of relief and took another breath.

No way! She must persevere! 

–

Xiao Chen began to wander off again. He recently felt that his memory was getting worse and worse, and he couldn’t even lift his spirits.

The school had been closed, students were not allowed to go out, and no one from the outside was allowed to come in. There were security lines set up everywhere, and countless police officers patrolled the area every day.

The breeze gently blew, stirring the hair that covered his eyes, making his gray eyes faintly visible. 

He had sneaked out.

Xiao Chen raised his head to look up at the tree above his head. The leaves fluttered gently as the wind blew.

“Su Yan?” Xiao Chen muttered, his expression somewhat trance-like.

He was now beginning to wonder if Su Yan was his imagination. 

The scene from that day would surface in his mind from time to time, but it wasn’t so real.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen took out his phone and somehow opened his Favorites in the bar.

Huh?

Xiao Chen was stunned. 

That post about him from yesterday had disappeared!

What happened?

Xiao Chen refreshed it twice.

If the post was deleted by the poster or by the administrator, those posts’ titles would still be in the Favorites list. But a reminder that they have been deleted will be displayed when they are clicked. They cannot disappear for no reason. 

What’s going on?!

Xiao Chen seemed to have thought of something else and directly exited the page and clicked on his chat software.

Xiao Chen paused.

Eh? Yesterday’s chats are gone too! 

Xiao Chen didn’t have the habit of deleting his chat logs because he didn’t have many friends and chatted less.

What happened?

Xiao Chen was horrified inside and immediately clicked on his friend bar.

When Xiao Chen saw clearly, his hand shook slightly, and his phone nearly fell off his hand. 

Wang Jingyi had disappeared from his list as well!

It was like something that was abnormal would be forcefully pulled back into its original path.

–

Zhou Yingmei’s face was ashen, and she pondered with her head propped up. 

The young officer on the side stood behind her with a walkie-talkie in his hand. He deliberately lowered his voice for fear of disturbing the captain’s train of thought. He muffled the whole time, repeating five or six times, “Roger.”

Turning off the radio, the young officer looked a little hesitant. He circled around a few times and bowed his head for a moment, before finally, he opened his mouth and said, “Captain, the person sent from above has arrived! Just waiting outside.”

Zhou Yingmei’s head, which was originally lowered, slowly lifted up, her appearance unchanged, “Mm, I see.”

After a pause, she seemed to have thought of something, “What’s the other person’s name?” 

The young officer pondered for five seconds and said somewhat hesitantly, “It seems to be called Su Yan.”

—— Remember, I will protect you!



A heavy rain fell without warning. 

The intensity of the rain was great, and the strength of the wind was even more astonishing.

When the wind blew, the windows and doors rattled. Even tree branches the size of a man’s arm swayed from side to side like flowers and plants being ravaged, while the thinner ones directly snapped into two parts under the double blow of the wind and rain.

What was even stranger was that, even though it was summer, it was extremely cold.

Zhou Ming was lying on his bed, facing the window of the room. 

There was no change in his expression. He was even a little numb; his eyes were dull.

The sound of the wind outside was very loud, so loud that it was hard to ignore, especially the sound of the doors and windows being rattled over and over again, which sounded annoying.

It was the second day since the school had suspended classes, and students were ordered to stay in their dormitories.

Zhou Ming was staring out the window. The fingers of his right hand kept rubbing his left thumb, looking a bit grave.

It was not clear whether he was staring out of the window at a flower or not. He withdrew his gaze, and his eyes fell on Xiao Chen, who was beside him.

Xiao Chen sat on the chair distracted, like a puppet with a broken string, a fragile piece of art, giving people an indescribable feeling.

The corner of Zhou Ming’s mouth slightly turned upward, and he crossed his arms and clasped them in front of his chest. Before Zhou Ming opened his mouth, Xiao Chen turned around unexpectedly and met Zhou Ming’s eyes with a heavy expression.

The air seemed to freeze, and the two of them looked at each other for three whole seconds. 

At last, Xiao Chen broke the silence.

He withdrew his gaze, and his bangs half covered his eyes. It was rare that he didn’t wear glasses today. Xiao Chen paused and said, “Do you know the answer to the question you asked me last time?”

—— “Do you know what the nature of the world is?”

—— “I don’t know.”

—— “I also don’t know.”

Zhou Ming’s expression faltered, and his lips moved. He supported his temples with his hands, and the veins on his neck popped up as if he had grasped a thread and it had suddenly snapped.

Had he forgotten something?

“I don’t remember ever asking you a question!” Zhou Ming paused and answered truthfully. 

Xiao Chen frowned and seemed like he wanted to say something.

“Shh, don’t speak.” A man’s voice appeared directly in his head.

Xiao Chen was shocked, and his body stirred.

This voice…… 

He couldn’t have heard it wrong.

It was Su Yan.

Because of this sentence, Xiao Chen managed to stop all his actions.

The man’s voice didn’t just disappear like what Xiao Chen thought. It was like an illusion. 

“Don’t be afraid, wait a little longer, and I’ll come to you!” The man’s voice was inexpressibly compelling. A few words calmed Xiao Chen’s heart, which was full of doubts. Even the anxiety that had been floating in his heart disappeared without a trace.

The man laughed softly, with unspoken affection, “Wait for me.”

Mmm, I’ll wait for you.

– 

“He’s dead.” A gust of wind blew and tossed the treetops, and the hollow voice reached the ears of the boy wearing a hospital gown.

The boy sat dumbly in his chair. His eyes were dull as if he had no interest in anything, and his whole body felt somewhat numb.

His eye sockets were sunken inward and had dark bruises under his glasses as if he hadn’t closed his eyes for several nights.

“He’s dead.” 

The boy’s ears moved slightly at the words. His teeth clenched, his face looked ashen, and his entire mental state was very gloomy.

“He’s dead!” The voice repeated.

The boy looked horrible. He finally lifted his head; his face was pale, and his features were twisted together. He looked around and roared out, “Shut up!”

The voice obviously didn’t stop because of his words, but instead, as if it had discovered a new world, it continued to make an unpleasant laughing sound, which was horrible, a bit like a baby’s cry. 

“He’s dead!!!” Hehe.

“He’s dead!!!” Aren’t you happy?

“Kekekekeke.” Are you about to fall apart?

His gray eyes were bloodshot. He suddenly stood up, grabbed the chair he had just been sitting on, and smashed it against the window. Like a deranged patient, he took two steps to rush to the window and hit his fists against the glass, ignoring his injuries. 

Both of his fists were still bandaged, and as soon as he smashed them, the red color seeped out, and the blood began to pour again.

“He had a fifty percent chance of being cured, you know?” The voice had enough laughing and continued.

The boy’s frantic movements stopped at this sentence. He swallowed and moved his Adam’s apple with a dull expression as if he was deceiving himself.

——What is your wish?

——I, I hope he gets better! And never be locked up in that little room again.

——Well, what would you trade for it?

——I… I don’t know what I could trade.

——Your life!

There was an image inserted into his mind without warning.

The boy’s already skinny back bent down without warning. His legs also bent slowly, and he directly fell to his knees on the floor, making a ‘duang‘ sound. His body also began to curl up into a ball, and his fingernails dug hard into the floor as if he had been greatly stimulated.

“Why are you pretending that you’re not healed already? Why do you deceive yourself?” The voice was still sarcastic.

The boy’s gray eyes slowly changed from self-loathing to becoming increasingly dark. He stared at the tree outside the window, and his eyes reflected the shadow of the tree’s body. 

“Kekekeke.” That voice was still making an inaudible harsh laugh.

The boy’s expression changed slightly.

Go to hell! Go to hell! All of you die!

None of you will live! 

Another gust of wind was blowing.

A spark came out of nowhere and was blown by the breeze and landed on the green tree outside the window.

First, it hit a leaf, and the sparks slowly ignited and spread, wrapping the whole tree in a raging fire.

The original sound of laughter in the room began to change its tune, turning into ear-piercing screams…the sound was loud and even more miserable. 

“Aaaaahhhhh!!!”

“What have you done?!!!”

The man’s voice was frantic like someone dying a gruesome death, his screams tragic and horrifying.

The boy’s gray eyes became dark, like a whirlpool that could devour the soul. 

—— It’s okay. You exchanged your soul with the Devil for me, so it is up to me to be the new Devil.

–

Luo Xiaoxiao looked to the left and right twice; her movements were a bit restrained. Her two hands gripped the corner of the wall and poked half her head out.

The rain was still falling like crazy, and drops of rain continued to hit the ground. 

When the wind blew, it casually blew her hair, which was casually braided.

She took her cell phone out of her pocket and then clicked on something. She pressed the phone screen a few times as if she was sending a message.

Luo Xiaoxiao: I’m here. When are you coming over?

Luo Xiaoxiao’s cheeks flushed a little. 

Her eyes looked around and back to the phone screen.

Recipient: Zhou Ming.

It was like a girl in a lady’s chamber waiting for the arrival of her beloved, filled with endless anticipation of what would happen when she met him.

– 

After an unknown time, Xiao Chen almost forgot to breathe.

The whistling wind outside the window was still blowing wildly, making loud noises.

In such a noisy environment, Xiao Chen could still clearly hear his heart pounding and a strange sound……coming from somewhere.

The sound of breathing. 

The sound of a male breathing.

But Xiao Chen’s heart was still at ease.

Although he was suspicious, he still didn’t ask the reason. He trusted Su Yan 100%.

However, the other party laughed lightly, not letting these questions haunt Xiao Chen’s mind for too long, and said, “Shh, don’t be afraid, the people above are patrolling here now.” 

Xiao Chen’s expression stiffened.

Above?

Su Yan seemed to see through the question in his heart and replied directly, “This is the mystery of this world.”

He paused and said, “The world is like a clock set to time, with a set trajectory. No matter how the hour, minute, or second hand turns, it just goes round and round in a circle.” 

“The fate of a clock is nothing more than to be sent to be repaired when it is out of balance, to set right what is wrong and bring it back to normal. When it cannot be restored and becomes a broken clock, it will be abandoned or even dismantled.”

Xiao Chen’s expression was somewhat dumbfounded. He seemed to understand, but at the same time, he did not understand.

Su Yan smiled, and with a change of words, he suddenly asked, “Do you know why Wang Jingyi died?”

Xiao Chen shook his head truthfully. 

But he would not forget the series of strange actions that Wang Jingyi did before her death.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen subconsciously covered his lips with his hand.

All of Wang Jingyi’s abnormal actions were done near the Wishing Tree, and even the place of her death was very close to the tree.

Xiao Chen raised his eyes, and a light flashed in his eyes. 

And he knew that the tree was related to Su Yan.

“Have you heard the story of the Wishing Tree?” Su Yan’s voice was filled with unconcealed affection.

Xiao Chen had some concerns and could only nod his head slightly.

Su Yan’s voice was uneventful, as if he was stating a fact without emotion, “Wang Jingyi was unwilling to be abandoned by Li Da and chose to use her youth to exchange for Li Da’s death. After his death, she became old overnight, so she foolishly used her knowledge to exchange for her beautiful face.” 

Xiao Chen’s expression moved slightly, somewhat complicated.

Su Yan chuckled again, “But, exchanging with the Devil has a price. Anyone who chooses to exchange with the Devil will be targeted by those above and will die.”

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows furrowed together.

What exactly was up there? 

Su Yan paused as if thinking about something, “Up there is a world that we can’t touch, and our experiences are just the talk of those people up there.”

Su Yan sneered, “Zhou Ming also exchanged with the Devil, did you know?”

Xiao Chen was horrified, and his eyes immediately went to Zhou Ming.

The latter was lying on the bed staring at the ceiling in a somewhat stunned state that was very different from his usual appearance. 

“So, he’ll be the next one to die.”



It had been raining for more than twelve hours, but the rain continued unabated. The water on the ground was almost over the threshold, almost up to one’s ankles. 

Wang Yeze’s face was grim, and his entire body was hidden behind the corner wall.

Half of his face was exposed, his eyes were bloodshot, and under them were all black and blue. Upon closer examination of his face, it was clear that his face was a bit pale, and even his breathing was a bit short.

Wang Yeze’s condition can be described as very much like a patient who can only survive on oxygen provided by an oxygen tank.

Wang Yeze’s eyes landed on Luo Xiaoxiao’s body. 

Luo Xiaoxiao had her back to him and was dressed neatly. She held her cell phone in both hands as if waiting for a reply from someone.

The distance between the two of them was not too close, but definitely not too far.

Wang Yeze’s face was hideous.

He was in a very critical situation.

He could clearly feel that his health was deteriorating. He even went to the hospital for a full body checkup, but the results showed that he was in perfect health.

He was lucky, but as he watched his body crumble little by little, he didn’t understand what was going on.

The feeling was subtle, as if something unavoidable was warning him to act quickly, or else the consequences would be unimaginable.

This feeling of clearly feeling the passing of life made him increasingly anxious and unable to calm down. 

The most unbearable thing was that he tried to contact the system for an explanation and help.

But it had been going on for days! He couldn’t summon the system at all! It’s as if the system never existed!

If it weren’t for the fact that his memories couldn’t be faked, he would have wondered if the existence of the system was a dream!

It disappeared too cleanly! There was no shadow, no trace of it. 

And the more reality set in, the more restless he felt.

So now, in his desperation, he has completely pinned his hopes on Luo Xiaoxiao.

Now, the only thing that keeps him alive is the belief that he should kill Luo Xiaoxiao.

He firmly believes that he has to kill her! 

He will live!

At this point, Wang Yeze clenched his fist and rubbed the knife he had hidden in his pocket.

He had used Zhou Ming’s identity to ask her to come here.

He knew that the relationship between Luo Xiaoxiao and Zhou Ming was not ordinary. 

Since Jiang Ling was dead and the Devil’s Bride was still alive, Luo Xiaoxiao was the biggest target.

Thinking of this, Wang Yeze looked around, and with his other hand on the wall, he planned to wait for the opportunity to act.

He couldn’t let go of this opportunity.

 

Zhou Ming stared out of the window, lost in thought. His eyebrows were furrowed together, and his eyes were somewhat empty.

Xiao Chen placed his arms between his legs and watched him from the corner of his eyes.

He has always had an inexplicable feeling about Zhou Ming.

There is another kind of wisdom in the world called the Da Zhi Ruo Yu, having great wisdom but not showing it. 

Zhou Ming may seem a bit inconspicuous in his day-to-day life, but Xiao Chen could see that there was something unfathomable about him.

Xiao Chen’s eyes flickered slightly.

Even when Zhou Ming asked him that day about the nature of the world, he had an unexplainable feeling that Zhou Ming knew more than he did.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen carefully probed with his mind, “Su Yan, what is the nature of the world?” 

There was silence in the air.

Xiao Chen took a deep breath and sighed a little.

It turned out that Su Yan couldn’t hear what he was saying inside.

However, Su Yan, who was silently guarding the side and observing Xiao Chen’s every move, seemed to have sensed something and did not miss any of Xiao Chen’s subtle expressions. 

“Is there something you want to ask me?” Su Yan’s voice was unexplainably compelling.

Xiao Chen had some concerns and could only nod his head slightly.

Su Yan smiled lightly.

Xiao Chen paused, feeling as if something cold held his hand. 

Xiao Chen subconsciously wanted to hide, but his body reacted faster than his brain and relaxed his guard.

It was like some kind of mollusk.

Xiao Chen could not help but think so.

It held Xiao Chen’s hand in its embrace and then guided his hand directly to grab the pendant hanging around his neck. 

Xiao Chen was confused.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m here.”

Xiao Chen’s face was a little red.

“You can talk to me with your mind now.” 

Xiao Chen was stunned.

For some reason, this scene felt familiar to him.

It was as if he had experienced it before.

Su Yan laughed silently. 

This necklace……

It does not belong to this world, but it belongs to Xiao Chen.

“What is the nature of the world?” Xiao Chen choked. His fingers kept fondling the pendant, looking a bit confused.

“This world we live in,” Xiao Chen’s eyes moved around, and he seemed to have an indescribable sense of vulnerability, “Is it real?” 

Are these people around me real?

Xiao Chen closed his eyes.

Su Yan, could it be real?

When Xiao Chen heard a soft laugh, he was stunned and blinked his eyes several times. 

Something came to his ear, and the tip of Xiao Chen’s ear felt a bit ticklish and even started to turn red.

“These, they are all fake.” Su Yan slowly said. “People are fake, animals are fake, and all of it is not real.”

Xiao Chen’s heart sank.

“But,” Su Yan paused, “the two of us are real, and our experiences are real.” 

Xiao Chen took a breath and calmed down.

In the next second, something soft came up to his earlobe and kissed it repeatedly.

Xiao Chen shuddered and had the feeling of being electrocuted.

“My love for you is also true.” 

–

Wang Yeze hid the knife behind his back and walked out with his head down.

Luo Xiaoxiao was delighted when she heard the sound of approaching footsteps and immediately raised her head with a joyful expression.

After seeing who was coming, her expression tightened, and she took a step back. She squeezed her phone tightly and unconsciously backed into the corner next to her. 

“Ta-da.” The sound of rain hitting the floor.

Wang Yeze’s eyes were fierce, and his right hand squeezed the dagger. With a sudden rush, he lunged directly at Luo Xiaoxiao.

“Ah!” Luo Xiaoxiao screamed out.

Wang Yeze’s face was hideous. He could be described as fast and vicious, directly grabbing the knife and stabbing her in the chest. 

Luo Xiaoxiao had no way to compete with Wang Yeze, who looked stronger than she was.

What’s more, it happened so suddenly that Luo Xiaoxiao’s legs immediately went weak with fear.

The knife plunged into Luo Xiaoxiao’s chest.

Luo Xiaoxiao’s eyes widened as her body convulsed. 

The blood directly stained her chest red.

“Ta-da.” The sound of the pattering rain directly overpowered the sound of her blood dripping on the ground.

Wang Yeze’s hands were shaking.

He swallowed, and his Adam’s apple moved. 

His eyes, which had been wide with shock, wavered.

Before he could blink, his pupils contracted as if he had seen something unexpected.

“Bang, bang, bang.” It sounded like something was beating violently, and it was louder than the sound of rain.

It was the sound of a heartbeat. 

Wang Yeze’s hand shook, and the knife fell to the ground with a loud “thud” sound.

He took a look around.

He tried to hold back the waves in his heart.

Luo Xiaoxiao was gone! 

A person just mysteriously disappeared right in front of his eyes!

–

Zhou Ming’s eyebrows suddenly furrowed slightly. Then, his face became grim, and his left hand, which was propped up on the bed, fiercely gripped the left part of his chest.

He looked down at his chest, with an expression that was somewhat trance-like and confused. His features were scrunched together like he was in pain, but in reality, no wounds could be seen on his body. 

Xiao Chen noticed something was wrong with him and immediately tried to sit up in his chair, but he was gently tapped on the shoulder by an invisible force and was directed to sit back down.

Xiao Chen sat back down after a pause, and he felt someone slowly lean into his ear and gently said.

“He used his knowledge and wisdom of the world to exchange for Jiang Ling’s death.”

“And decided to trade his own life for Luo Xiaoxiao’s chance of survival at a critical moment.” 

This was Zhou Ming’s love and protection for Luo Xiaoxiao.

–


“Officer Zhou,” The man appeared calm with his back straight. He did not look like a police officer but rather like a model in a show. Both his appearance and his temperament were extremely distinguished. 

Zhou Yingmei frowned, looking up and down at the man in front of her.

Women always have a magical sixth sense for something dangerous.

Su Yan took out a pile of materials from his handbag and put them on the table, the corners of his mouth slightly raised.

“Although I have only now been officially transferred to the team of this case,” The man lifted his gaze, and his gray eyes had an indescribable depth to them. The tone of his voice was flat but inexplicably convincing, “but I intervened in the investigation of this incident at the same time as you.” 

Zhou Yingmei’s frown deepened when she heard this.

Su Yan smiled, but there was no smile in his eyes, “Officer Zhou should take a look at the information I have prepared.”

The man’s eyes grew darker as if he was compelling the people, “I believe,”

Pursing his lips, “These things can be very helpful in the investigation.

Zhou Yingmei did not say a word. Although she is a woman, she was able to become the leader of the group. A woman who stands out in a crowd of men. She relies on her wise brain and physical ability, and the most important point, that is  the aura.

But her always confident aura seemed a little too small in front of this man.

Zhou Yingmei received the information prepared by the man with questions and doubts.

But more than all the strange concerns in her head, she cared most about solving the case quickly. 

She flipped through the file, and her expression changed instantly.

Su Yan stood opposite her and could clearly see all the slight changes in her expression.

Zhou Yingmei paused and softly read out the person’s name in the file, “Wang Yeze?”

Su Yan slightly raised his head, the muscle lines on his face were tight, and the contours were firm. 

Zhou Yingmei didn’t have time to pay attention to his every move. She had been completely absorbed by this information.

Su Yan slowly sat down in the nearby seat with no rush. It was very leisurely, and it seemed like the corners of his mouth contained a faint smile.

The game will be over soon, won’t it?

Heh. 

And there would only be one result.

–

Wang Yeze was so terrified that his hands could not stop shaking, and his body was frozen in place as if he had not yet slowed down from the immediate shock. His head was instantly accompanied by a violent headache, like thousands of ants gnawing at his brain.

“Fuck,” Wang Yeze cursed out, his whole body directly paralyzed on the ground and rolled. He felt like he was sucked by something unknown; something was going to peel off from his body, like being split into pieces by five horses. 

“Ahhhhh!” Wang Yeze couldn’t stand it, and his eyes widened in anger.

“System save me, save me!!!” Wang Yeze subconsciously shouted out, as if he was grasping the last straw desperately and pulling at it.

Miraculously, the system that had disappeared for a long time was actually re-summoned by him at this moment. But before he could rejoice, a pot of cold water was poured directly on his head.

“The system startup is in progress…Zi…zi…” 

Just like the sudden pain in his brain, he could only feel a stabbing, prickly electric current pounding in his head.

“System!!! Quick! Help me!!!” Wang Yeze screamed out at the top of his voice.

“The system senses danger! The system is preparing to disengage!” The system seemed to convulse, and the volume of its voice suddenly amplified. Although the voice was mechanical as before, it resembled a human being who could hardly conceal the panic in its tone.

“Pong!” 

There was a loud bang, and Wang Yeze’s body jerked, bounced a few times before directly fainting.

The system also stopped shouting as if it had crashed.

It was unknown how long it took.

“The danger is lifted. The system is starting to detach. Stand by, three, two, zi…zi…zi…” The system’s voice resounded with a bit of joy for coming back from the dead. But before it could celebrate for long, it was once again cut off forcefully, just like a person pressed down on a dead end and unable to breathe. 

Before the system completely lost consciousness, it seemed to hear a man’s magnetic voice.

He said, “Heh, I finally got you.”

Something from the world above?

Do you think you could escape? Heh. 

The man rested his chin in his hand, resembling a model that was posing nicely, and every frame was pleasing to the eye.

His gray eyes flickered as if he had just been briefly distracted, but it was not obvious, and no one noticed.

Zhou Yingmei closed the file, her heart in turmoil, unable to calm down.

Her lips were chapped, and her throat itched. 

She took a sharp intake of breath and said, “Your information is really helpful to the case.”

Su Yan’s appearance remained unchanged at the words.

Zhou Yingmei didn’t care about his attitude. She picked up her radio and ordered, “Go and call the boy named Wang Yeze to the police station for an interview; the information will be sent to you right away.”

Su Yan suddenly smiled, and Zhou Yingmei cast a questioning glance at him. However, when she looked over, Su Yan’s face was still paralyzed with no fluctuations, as if the scene just now was merely her illusion. 

Zhou Yingmei shook her head, not taking it to heart.

–

Zhou Ming trembled all over, and his face was wrinkled beyond recognition.

Xiao Chen cast his eyes away and lowered them with some hidden meaning, “He’s going to die now, isn’t he?” 

There was a sudden chuckle in the air as if nothing was wrong.

His baby is really too cute.

Su Yan seemed to have had enough of laughing and replied seriously, while his tone carried undisguised spoiling, “As long as you want, he won’t.”

Xiao Chen paused, his fingers repeatedly rubbed on his pendant, a bit confused, “What do you mean?” 

Su Yan’s eyes fell on Xiao’s pendant.

This is not something from this world.

It seemed to be from a parallel world similar to the current one.

It was also because of this necklace that he saw some recorded images of other worlds. 

Death and a boy.

Su Yan thought of this and paused.

He received a warning from the God of Death.

An advice that he must vow to guard Xiao Chen to the death. 

Su Yan leaned close to Xiao Chen and said, “This necklace you’re holding, it’s much more useful than what you see.”

After all, this necklace comes from the world of the God of Death. It is a talisman used by the God of Death to guard his beloved one, a magical device that can escape the eyes of the Heavens.

“?” Xiao Chen’s questions grew even deeper.

“Its power can directly destroy the space we live in.” Su Yan looked at Xiao Chen’s eyelashes, dazed, counting one after the other, and he couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart. 

It’s beautiful.

“You only need to think about it sincerely, and then Zhou Ming will not die.” Su Yan’s gaze moved directly down to Xiao Chen’s lips, and his tongue immediately became dry from watching him.

You have the ability to do so if you want to.

– 



Zhou Ming snapped his eyes open and looked around. His face was a bit fierce as his eyebrows furrowed together, and his forehead was wrinkled. 

Alive.

He was in disbelief as if he didn’t expect he would still be alive. Not knowing what kind of stimulus he had received, he suddenly reacted, and his first words as he sat up were, “Xiaoxiao! Did something happen to her?!”

Xiao Chen stood beside Zhou Ming’s bed, examining his face as carefully as if he were getting to know him for the first time.

Xiao Chen said softly, “She’s fine,” and added, “She’s in her dormitory, and she should be asleep by now.” 

Zhou Ming’s heart was relieved, and he managed to curl the corners of his mouth and nod his head. He didn’t look too good, as if his life was at stake like he had just crawled out of death.

Xiao Chen looked at his face and stared into his eyes, “Do you want to be with Luo Xiaoxiao forever?”

Zhou Ming’s eyes flickered, and the next moment became a little evasive. He looked away as if he were talking to himself, “So what if I want to? It is impossible for me and her.”

This tone was not like the sigh of a suitor who could not catch up with his Goddess.

Xiao Chen frowned.

Instead, it was more like knowing the ending of a movie in advance, so when you watch the movie, you have already prepared yourself to stop the damage in time.

“Why?” Xiao Chen said the question directly.

Zhou Ming laughed at himself, “Do you know about survival games?” 

Xiao Chen looked at him inquiringly.

“In this world, everyone is a loser except the first place, and the second place is the biggest loser because he is much closer to it than everyone else.”

“In a survival game, no matter how many participants there are, and no matter how hard you try in the process, the end result is the same, only one person can survive.”

“So, in the course of the game, some people will draw their swords because of the conflict of interest, and some will choose to commit suicide because of fear of the future. They can unite like a rope at first, but slowly, when all the enemies are gone and wiped out, they will start to kill their closest people to survive. Just like the ancient times when children were easy to eat, the first to be eliminated was the physically disabled, the children, and the women. Finally, the men fight to the death.” 

Zhou Ming’s eyes look like they can devour people’s souls, and Xiao Chen was frozen.

“I live to keep her alive.” Zhou Ming’s eyes were firm.

“I will also die so that she can live.”

Xiao Chen seemed to be stimulated, and his heart pounded with fear. 

He reached out and grabbed his collar, feeling a little breathless.

It seemed like someone, too, had once said such words to him.

“Senior, I will protect you.”

“An angel can kill his beloved for the sake of the world! But the Devil can kill the whole world for his beloved.” 

“You don’t need to know how many people I’ve killed for you!” 

“And the only thing I ask of you is that you be able to protect yourself!” 

Is that…

Su Yan? 

Zhou Ming’s gaze darted back and forth over Xiao Chen’s body, and not knowing what was on his mind, he snorted out a laugh. “I had thought that after I had caught a glimpse of the world’s secrets and knew the end, I would be able to die openly for her.”

His eyes suddenly hardened, and his gaze fell on Xiao Chen, “But I met you by chance!”

“You won’t die! You’re outside the rules!!!” Zhou Ming spoke out coldly.

“You don’t have to do anything, you just have to stand here, and you will be able to live well until the end!!!” 

“But not me!!!” Zhou Ming’s anger subsided, and his expression once again returned to indifference, “I just want to protect her.”

Luo Xiaoxiao accidentally bumped into Wang Jingyi, who died suddenly of a heart attack by the pool. She was directly shocked, and it was he who sent her back to the dormitory and then threw Wang Jingyi’s body into the pool.

Jiang Ling made a series of false statements related to Luo Xiaoxiao, wanting to drive her to death. Hence, he made a wish to the Wishing Tree, causing Jiang Ling to commit suicide.

He did not even hesitate to put his own life on the line to save Luo Xiaoxiao when her life was hanging by a thread. 

He never had regrets and complaints.

“So what exactly is the nature of the world?” Xiao Chen finally asked the question he wanted to ask the most out loud.

Zhou Ming raised his head, his eyes dull, “The nature of the world is just a movie.”

Xiao Chen was stunned, and his breathing faltered. 

Su Yan’s words once again appeared to him, “These worlds are all fake, people are fake, animals are fake, everything is not real.”

Everyone’s fate was predetermined to end from the beginning of creation.

So that’s how it is.

Xiao Chen craned his neck, ignoring Zhou Ming’s surprised gaze, and said seriously, “You will not die.” 

The rules always get broken.

Xiao Chen’s tone was direct and uninteresting as if he was telling someone that the weather was nice today.

Xiao Chen’s gaze slowly moved to the windowsill and looked out the window, and Zhou Ming also followed his gaze.

At some point, the heavy rain had stopped. The sun was shining through, reaching the cactus on the windowsill and spreading a halo of light. 

After the rain, wouldn’t there be a rainbow?

–

“I plead guilty. I killed them!” Wang Yeze’s eyes were hollow, like a puppet, and his movements were somewhat stiff. His body was straight, and his tone was flat.

During the process of being summoned, he did not say a word from the beginning to the end. He surrendered directly after entering the interrogation room. 

Zhou Yingmei’s eyebrows twitched, and her pupils contracted sharply.

She did not expect the suspect to give himself up directly.

Wang Yeze continued, “I like Wang Jingyi very much, so I held a grudge against Li Da, whom Wang Jingyi likes. Especially that day, I followed Jingyi, then saw her begging him on her knees to get back together. Still, Li Da humiliated and disdained her in every way.” Although Wang Yeze’s words were very moving, his expression did not fluctuate in the slightest.

“So my hatred for Li Da reached its peak. I didn’t think about killing Li Da, but then he kicked Jingyi, and I became completely furious. I rushed out directly and killed him in front of Jingyi.” 

Su Yan stood behind Zhou Yingmei, with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth, calmly listening to Wang Yeze’s confession.

Wang Yeze’s eyes kept staring ahead. The light in the room was dark, so Zhou Yingmei didn’t even notice that Wang Yeze’s gaze wasn’t on her level but through her, falling onto the person behind her.

Wang Yeze and Su Yan stared at each other. The former was blank, while the latter was indifferent.

“But then Jingyi forced me to turn myself in, I was terrified!” 

“I really didn’t know her family history of heart disease. That day she came to persuade me again, so I argued with her. Maybe she was too emotional, then she had a heart attack and just stopped breathing… I was even more scared! But I couldn’t be found out! So I just threw her into the pool.”

Su Yan narrowed his eyes, his expression remained unchanged.

Wang Yeze added, “But Jiang Ling and Yang Sun’s death has nothing to do with me, I don’t know anything.”

For some reason, Zhou Yingmei felt something and suddenly looked back at Su Yan. Su Yan looked at her and smiled politely. 

Zhou Yingmei put away all kinds of discomfort in her heart.

And asked, “Now, you will recount the tools and methods you used to kill Li Da.”

Wang Yeze’s expression remained very blank. He paused and nodded, as if he had expected that Zhou Yingmei would ask so, and continued to speak.

Su Yan, however, no longer looked at him, nor Zhou Yingmei. He hooked the corners of his mouth and exited the room calmly. 

Zhou Yingmei’s note-taking hand paused, and she turned her head slightly to look back, and then continued the interrogation.

She always felt that things were unusual, her subconscious told her that things should not be like this, but all the signs show that the killer has been captured by them and is the person in front of her.

Although the findings were not announced, the police department has long blamed Jiang Ling’s death on too much stress, leading to depression and suicide. At the same time, Yang Sun’s death was also attributed to staying up too late and eating junk food for a long time.

If it was truly Wang Yeze who killed Li Da and Wang Jingyi, then the case would basically be closed! 

Zhou Yingmei took a deep breath.

But why does she always feel like she’s missing some important clue?

–

Zhou Ming has been standing under the girls’ dormitory for nearly two hours. He stood there like a landscape that has attracted the inquiring eyes of countless girls passing back and forth. 

He did not care much and just remained standing below.

He was holding a thermos cup in his hand, and he looked a little dazed.

A slender figure appeared under the girls’ dormitory door, and Zhou Ming’s eyes instantly lit up, and he looked completely bright.

He shouted, “Xiaoxiao.” 

Luo Xiaoxiao was startled, and her initially pale face took on an extra touch of red.

She seemed to have slept for a long time and had a long dream, and there were many things she couldn’t quite remember.

Now she had a feeling of unreality, but this was swept away when she saw Zhou Ming. What ushered in was an indescribable satisfaction.

Zhou Ming felt a wave of chagrin after shouting as if he had done something wrong. 

It’s over. It’s over, what should he say at this time?

Luo Xiaoxiao smiled and walked directly towards him, stroked her hair with her hand, and said softly, “Are you waiting for me?”

Zhou Ming looked at the girl in front of him and blinked as if he was smitten.

Luo Xiaoxiao had to repeat it again. 

Zhou Ming suddenly woke up and stammered, “No, no, no, I was just taking a walk, and then, then I just happened to pass by.”

Luo Xiaoxiao froze and burst out laughing.

The whole area was a girls’ dormitory. Who would take a walk here?

Zhou Ming handed the thermos cup to Luo Xiaoxiao’s hand without saying anything and said, “That ah, aren’t you on your period now? Drink more brown sugar water! Drink more brown sugar water!!!” 

Luo Xiaoxiao choked.

How did he know?

Zhou Ming chuckled, “Then I’ll go first, don’t catch a cold.”

After saying that, he intended to turn around and leave. 

Luo Xiaoxiao subconsciously grabbed Zhou Ming’s sleeve, which made Zhou Ming looked back at her. Luo Xiaoxiao looked like she didn’t expect that she would be so rash either, so her face burst red, and then she said, “Right, sorry.”

“That, that,” Luo Xiaoxiao began to stammer, not daring to meet Zhou Ming’s eyes, “I like you.”

Zhou Ming was stunned, like a little fool eating a candied fruit staring wide-eyed, frozen in place.

Luo Xiaoxiao blushed with a few complaints, “Shouldn’t you also say you like me at this time?” 

Zhou Ming didn’t say anything at first, but as soon as he embraced Luo Xiaoxiao in his arms, he said, “I love you.”

It’s not just that I like you, it’s that I love you.

I love you.

Su Yan put Xiao Chen in his arms. His chin was against Xiao Chen’s shoulder, and his eyes squinted like a contented puppy. 

Xiao Chen poked Su Yan’s nose with his index finger.

It was soft and moved gently once poked.

Su Yan held Xiao Chen tighter, and then he kissed him on the neck.

“Are you a dog?” Xiao Chen laughed in exasperation. 

Su Yan paused, then said with a straight face, “No, I’m your brother.”

Xiao Chen was stunned at first.

The air seemed to suddenly stop for two seconds.

Xiao Chen’s face directly burst red, as if he thought of something, then tried to break free from Su Yan’s embrace, but was hugged even tighter by the latter. 

“Didn’t you always call me that when you were a kid?” Su Yan couldn’t help but tease Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen struggled even more.

“Shh.” Su Yan gestured for Xiao Chen to be silent.

Xiao Chen immediately stopped moving. 

Su Yan laughed and held both of Xiao Chen’s hands tightly in his palms, then carefully dropped a kiss.

“I love you, my little rose.”

Xiao Chen teased, “I love you too.”

My Mr. Snake.




The weather is sunny, and the breeze is light, revealing a sense of warmth. 

Pedestrians on the road come and go, and there are not too many of them. They basically in pairs or a group of people walking together. One look around reveals a youthful and energetic image of the young people, and very few of them are alone.

Of course, there are exceptions to everything.

For example,

Like Xiao Chen! 

He was leisurely sitting in the front of the open-air milk tea store. He was sitting in an upright posture with his back straight. He was dressed in a white T-shirt and tight jeans, an ordinary outfit, but he wore it with a sense of sophistication. The wind gently stirred his soft hair, and the corners of his clothes were also slightly whipped up.

One of his hands was holding milk tea, and the other was propped up on the table. His fingers were also rhythmically tapping on the table, and he looked around a few times before finally landing on the fountain park not far away. His eyes looked a little blank, as if he was waiting for someone.

Xiao Chen touched his hair and couldn’t help but yawn. He was a little sleepy in a short while, and his eyes were a bit distant as if he could fall asleep in the next second.

“Catch the thief! Catch the thief!” The street, which was not too noisy, was broken by the woman’s ear-splitting shout.

Xiao Chen had a jolt, his sleepiness instantly blew away, and he jerked his head up.

The surrounding crowd seemed to be afraid of being affected. As a result, everyone had the sense to back away to the side, allowing the man wearing a mask and hat to take out the bag of the woman wearing a short skirt and high heels.

The woman wore high heels and could not run, not to mention that the other party is obviously an experienced repeat offender. The strength of the two was very different. In a short time, the two were separated by a very significant distance. Seeing that the man was going to escape, no passers-by came forward. Xiao Chen is not a warm-hearted person but did not ignore it.

He had a basic judgment of the thief almost at a glance. His pants were tight black jeans with no pockets. His top had shallow pockets, and his clothes were thin enough not to hide any dangerous props. 

The man is about the same size as him. The body is also on the thin side but a lot of leg muscles. He wore a pair of running shoes without a brand, with a mask and a hat prepared.

There is no doubt that the other party is an experienced robbery. In this era of scanning code payment, everyone has a mobile phone. The chances of going out with cash basically tends to zero. Hence, the attention of robbers began to turn to grab leather bags, designer bags.

This man ran in the direction of exactly where Xiao Chen was sitting.

After weighing the pros and cons, Xiao Chen stood up and tried to help the strange woman. 

However, before he stood up completely straight, he was held down by a pair of large hands on his shoulders. Then, he was pushed back to the chair with force.

When Xiao Chen turned his head with confused eyes, Su Yan was standing behind him with a calm face.

In Xiao Chen’s surprised eyes, Su Yan said in a stern voice, “Do not move.”

Then, without hesitation, he rushed out and tried to block the way of the robber. 

The man obviously did not expect anyone to rush out to stop him. He stumbled over his feet and took two more steps forward by inertia. He whipped his head around, intending to run in the other direction.

Su Yan was very tall, with a height of more than 1.9 meters. He dashed and took two or three steps forward and soon grabbed the man’s collar.

Before the man’s fierce resistance, Su Yan has a stern look, and his hands grabbed the other’s throat. The man subconsciously let go of the bag in his hand and tried to break free from the man’s restraint. His face turned blue because he could not breathe.

The passers-by on the sidelines were utterly shocked by this reversal and dropped their jaws. 

Even the female owner of the bag was frozen in place and did not dare to go forward.

Seeing that it was almost close to taking a life, Xiao Chen rushed out. Before Xiao Chen could speak, Su Yan released the man’s throat. He took out a string of shackles from nowhere and locked the man’s hands.

The process was smooth and seamless, and it took no more than a minute to complete.

The man was released from the neck and coughed violently. He did not even have the strength to resist; he slightly opened his eyes and knelt on the ground. His eyes met with Su Yan’s, and it was this look that scared the man to silence. 

Su Yan looked at him from above with a blank face. His eyes were gloomy as if he was looking at a dead man, and they seemed to have a soul-eating magic. In just one glance, the man could feel an unprecedented pressure on him, like a demon crawling out of hell to claim his life.

The man’s heart is in turmoil, and his brain is blank.

Su Yan hooked the corner of his mouth, and his gray eyes moved.

The man’s body weakened and uncontrollably went straight to the ground as he looked on in horror. 

Xiao Chen walked to Su Yan’s side and stood meekly behind him.

Su Yan turned around and smiled at Xiao Chen without shying away from the fact that he was already the focus of everyone in the crowd. He directly took the other’s hand in his own palm and then reverently kissed the other’s finger.

The surrounding instantly resounded a gasp of surprise.

Xiao Chen and Su Yan’s faces in the crowd are overly eye-catching. Coupled with their tall figures, they were incredibly pleasing to the eye at a glance. 

However, these two people are unexpectedly a couple?

This is the idea of everyone at this time.

Su Yan swept an in-depth look at the man and, for some reason, suddenly hooked the corners of his mouth and then pulled out his cell phone from his pocket. This scene gave people a kind of gentle and scum-like temperament.

The phone was connected, Su Yan smiled towards Xiao Chen, and then spoke without haste, “Officer Zhou, send someone to the city center’s pedestrian street. The suspect of your current case is here.” 

After saying that, Su Yan looked down at the man paralyzed on the ground like a dead body.

After the man heard his words clearly, his body shuddered, and his pupils shook as if he didn’t expect to be caught. He tried to open his mouth to argue something for himself, but it was at this moment that he suddenly realized that his voice seemed to be stuck by glue. No sound came out no matter how hard he tried.

Su Yan hung up the phone, led Xiao Chen directly to the position where he just sat. The female owner trembled and came over, and Su Yan glanced at her. The latter was like being splashed with ice water, frozen in place.

This man’s eyes are so scary. 

By the time Zhou Yingmei arrived on the scene, Su Yan and Xiao Chen sat together intimately, interlocking their fingers while drinking milk tea.

Zhou Yingmei saw Su Yan and a boy so sitting together. When she saw Xiao Chen’s face, she froze in place, and her pupils widened almost subconsciously. She then looked at Su Yan’s expression, who was staring at her with a smile.

He had no concern about wrapping his arm around Xiao Chen’s shoulders and playing with the hair that was sticking up on top of his head.

That boy……… 

Isn’t he the previous suspect of that case?

Zhou Yingmei’s body almost shivered as if it had been splashed with cold water.

After the case was closed, the murderer Wang Yeze committed suicide in prison. Still, she has always had a sense of unreality inside and felt that there were too many mysteries in the middle unresolved. It has been a year since that incident, but she is still haunted by it.

How could these two..? 

Su Yan and Xiao Chen stood up, intending to leave.

Xiao Chen couldn’t help but mutter, then licked his dry lips, “I drank it up.”

Su Yan was amused and said in a helpless and somewhat spoiled way, “Then, let’s go home.”

“Mm, go home.” 

Go home ah.

Home is such a cozy word. A house where two people stay and live an ordinary life together is enough.



Arc 4 - The Murder Game


“Knock, knock.” There was a knock on the door. 

“Anyone? Is there anyone here?” A woman’s voice called out.

Xiao Chen shuddered as he opened his eyes and sat up with a perplexed expression.

At this moment, he was lying in an unfamiliar room. The room was decorated in a western gothic style. The room doesn’t even have a lamp, and there were only a few candles of varying lengths burning by the bed, emitting a weak light.

Where is this? 

Xiao Chen clenched his hand on his chest to hide his panic.

It’s so dark.

He curled up in a ball, covered his body with the quilt, and hid his head, tears welling up in his eyes.

“Is anyone there?” The woman’s voice sounded again.

Xiao Chen’s eyes lit up, his head peeked out from the blanket, and he immediately got up. Before he could walk off the bed, he frowned again. His expression was very aggrieved.

How come there are no shoes.

His white feet were striking when he stepped on the floor. Because he was very slender, he was like a porcelain doll when the glowing candlelight shone on him.

Xiao Chen was wearing clothes that did not match his body size at all. It was a set of cream pajamas, giving the illusion of a child who stole adults’ clothes. 

He picked up the bedside candle and moved cautiously towards the door with his muscles tense.

Fortunately, the floor was covered with a rug.

Xiao Chen couldn’t help but think this in his head.

Xiao Chen pushed the door with his hand, trying to open it. 

It didn’t work; maybe it because his strength was too low.

Xiao Chen grumbled and pushed again.

“Is there anyone? Is there anyone here?” The woman is still shouting, but the sound is getting farther and farther away as if the person is slowly leaving the area.

Seeing that the person is getting farther away, Xiao Chen instantly shouted with red eyes, “I’m here! I’m here!” 

While shouting, his hand also pounded on the door.

Maybe he was so distressed that his tears also fell uncontrollably.

He was unsure if it was an illusion, but Xiao Chen seemed to hear a man’s sigh. The voice was gentle, seemingly helpless, and somewhat doting.

The next second, the door opened automatically. 

Xiao Chen breathed a sigh of relief, and his tears also stopped, but he looked very delicate.

The woman should have heard his shout. Xiao Chen pushed open the door and clearly heard two footsteps of varying pace slowly approaching in this direction.

Xiao Chen swallowed and held the candle with some fear, and his other hand was glued to the door.

Perhaps it is because of the light that the footsteps quickly moved over to his position. 

It was a man and a woman.

The man wore a black suit and looked like a young celebrity.

The woman had curly hair, exquisite makeup and was wearing high heels with a short skirt. The corners of her mouth held a smile, and there was an indescribable look in her eyes that carried deep emotion.

While Xiao Chen was sizing up the two, the two were also looking up and down at Xiao Chen. 

“Child, tell sister, where is this place?” The woman gave a light laugh, breaking the eerie silence of the three.

It’s no wonder the woman called Xiao Chen child. Xiao Chen had a small frame and was white and tender-looking. He looked like he was just 16 or 17 years old.

Xiao Chen’s two feet moved around with restraint. He shook his head timidly and said fearfully, “I don’t know, I just woke up here after a nap!”

The woman’s expression remained unchanged. It was not clear whether she believed him or not, but she continued to ask, “So how old are you now, and where is your home?” 

Xiao Chen was a little afraid as his intuition told him that the woman in front of him was a bit dangerous. However, he still answered honestly, “I’m twenty years old and a college student. Before I woke up, I was reading in the school library.

Xiao Chen’s voice got smaller and smaller, and his expression had a kind of dream-like distortion.

The woman did not speak, and the three just continue to stand still.

The man glanced at Xiao Chen and said indifferently, “All right, you follow us now, and we’ll continue to see if there are others here.” 

After speaking, the two turned around and walked forward without looking back, not caring about Xiao Chen behind them.

But those two people do not seem to be acquaintances as there was always a distance between them, and they also look guarded.

Xiao Chen paused, looked at his feet, and wrinkled into a bitter face. He also did not dare to make any requests and could only follow them with eyes wide open.

“Heh.” Xiao Chen seemed to hear another man’s cold laugh. 

Xiao Chen turned his head around, thinking that he had heard wrong.

A gust of wind blew, and the woman in front touched her arm, feeling a little cold.

But it was strange that even if Xiao Chen’s feet were on the floor and his pajamas were thin, he didn’t feel the slightest bit of coldness and was even a little warm.

Xiao Chen surveyed the surroundings. 

The whole house is gothic style, very dark and vintage. Numerous oil paintings hung on the walls, but even the paintings were basically black and white and gray in tone. There were also some animal-like sculptures nailed to the walls.

The reason why it is just similar to animals is because those sculptures were either missing a leg or had no head, which was very strange to see.

Xiao Chen is very timid, and his heart kept beating hard when he saw these things in front of him.

“There is someone.” The man suddenly announced. 

Xiao Chen froze, then heard the sound of footsteps.

The woman instantly looked with a wary expression.

“Hey, who are you guys?” It was an old uncle who looked as if he was 40 or 50 years old. His beard was messy, and he was wearing an ill-fitting leather jacket. His hairline was a bit high, his stomach was big, and his figure was out of shape.

The man and woman looked at each other, and the man stepped forward, “I’m Su Jingxia, and she’s Jin Tiantian.” 

Su Jingxia’s gaze fell on Xiao Chen, who immediately added, “I’m Xiao Chen.”

The three of them stared at the older man in front of them at the same time.

However, the old man’s gaze directly crossed Xiao Chen and Su Jingxia and landed on Jin Tiantian. His gaze was very explicit and could be described as undisguisedly lustful.

Jin Tiantian looked unchanged as if she did not feel the malice in his eyes, or perhaps she felt it but did not care. 

The old man said, “I am He Yili. Where is this place?”

Another stranger who didn’t know where this place was.

Xiao Chen also vaguely sensed something.

Su Jingxia shook his head, “All three of us appeared here out of nowhere.” 

He Yili revealed his yellow teeth as he pulled a smile and moved closer to Jin Tiantian’s direction.

Jin Tiantian did not hide. Instead, when the man’s hand reached directly to her waist, she pretended to be shy and knocked the man’s chest with her hand.

It is like the look of wanting to refuse but still welcoming.

The pure Xiao Chen looked blankly at the two people in front of him and wondered why they were hugging each other. 

But it was really just a hug, and the two quickly let go.

Where the hell is this?

Xiao Chen was very scared.

Perhaps it is because he is too timid that his face became very red. When the atmosphere of the four people became more and more bizarre, he opened his mouth and said, “I want to go to the toilet. Where is the toilet!” 

Jin Tiantian’s blushing expression remained unchanged. She glanced at Xiao Chen, and not knowing what was in her mind, she casually pointed in a direction. With some unknown light flashing in her eyes, she replied, pretending to be serious, “I seemed to have just seen the toilet there.”

Su Jingxia glanced at Jin Tiantian and did not make a sound.

Xiao Chen’s face reddened even more with embarrassment. He followed the direction the woman pointed and moved carefully.

It was so dark. 

Before Xiao Chen could walk out of a few hundred meters, his eyes were red again as if he would cry in the next second.

Xiao Chen walked for a few more minutes. He looked at the candle in his hand that was getting shorter and shorter and could not last long, but he could not even find the toilet, and then his tears shortly fell.

Before he could regain his composure, he saw a person standing not far from this section of the corridor. He couldn’t see their face clearly and only saw a vague figure.

Xiao Chen’s choking sound was stuck in his throat, and his body trembled severely. 

It was not clear what he was thinking, but he watched the blurry figure approaching his direction, and he didn’t run away, nor did he scream.

When it came closer, Xiao Chen’s heart relaxed.

It turned out to be a person.

A man. 

At this moment, Xiao Chen realized that his legs had softened from the fright, and he fell directly to the ground.

He looked up with a stupid expression and froze when he met the man’s gray eyes.

The man didn’t say a word and condescendingly looked at Xiao Chen.

The two looked at each other for ten seconds. 

Xiao Chen was then stunned by the other party’s next action.

The man actually reached out and hugged Xiao Chen in his arms. Xiao Chen was suspended in the air for a moment and subconsciously tried to break free from the other party’s embrace.

The man frowned, and the hand holding Xiao Chen’s waist patted his backside directly with force. The man’s hoarse voice sounded like he was coaxing, “Behave, don’t move.”

Xiao Chen was stunned. This was the first time he was hit in that place in his life and by a man. 

His face burst red for a second, and he struggled even more to free his body.

“Let go of me! Let go of me!”

The man’s gray eyes flashed, seemingly puzzled. Seeing that Xiao Chen was still struggling, he thought it was because Xiao Chen couldn’t hold it anymore. So, he stopped him even tighter instead.

“Don’t worry. I’ll carry you to the toilet now.” 

The man paused as if afraid that Xiao Chen would continue to resist, and directly aimed at Xiao Chen’s mouth and planted a kiss.

It was not some butterfly-like light kiss but a heated kiss. After the man blocked Xiao Chen’s mouth, he actually stuck his tongue in. The tip of his tongue licked Xiao Chen’s gums countless times. It even took the initiative to entangle with Xiao Chen’s tongue, wanting to invite it to dance together.

The man’s feet were not idle either. While Xiao Chen was stunned by this kiss, he even held the kiss while walking towards the toilet’s direction.

It is unknown how long the kiss was. Xiao Chen was in a daze when he was finally put down. 

The man chuckled lightly, “Do you need me to help you take off your pants?”

—


“……” 

“……”

The two of them stared at each other wide-eyed. Xiao Chen curled his lips, and tears began to roll in his eyes again. He almost came close to crying out.

The man paused as he looked at this wrinkled little face. For some reason, his heart inexplicably had a strange sense of satisfaction. With a doting tone that he did not realize, and while rubbing the child’s hair, he said in a soft voice, “Okay, okay, you do it yourself.”

But the next second, the man’s gaze unconsciously moved to Xiao Chen’s bare feet. 

This pair of bare feet was so white in the darkness that it seemed to be glowing. It was very eye-catching, as his feet were beautiful. It was so white that you could even see the veins, and the small and pink toes were so pretty that they were like a work of art.

The man’s stare couldn’t help but make Xiao Chen dodge and move his feet around.

The man’s eyes became even more dangerous, with a bit of indescribable charm in his eyes.

Xiao Chen is a little bit distressed.

He has not gone to the toilet yet.

Xiao Chen felt very aggrieved.

The next second, the man pulled out a pair of shoes from nowhere and put them directly into his hands.

He glanced at Xiao Chen and squatted down, ignoring Xiao Chen’s confusion. He directly grabbed the other party’s left foot and held it in his hand. Xiao Chen was startled again. The feeling of losing balance scared him so much that he immediately grabbed the other party’s shoulders with both hands. It tickles. 

The man’s movements were very light, grabbing Xiao Chen’s feet and wiping them on his own sleeve without disdain.

Xiao Chen directly turned red and subconsciously shrunk back. The man did not pay attention to Xiao Chen’s expression. He held the bare feet tighter, and in the next second, he placed it directly on his thighs for support. Then, he pulled out a pair of white socks from his pocket and carefully put them on for Xiao Chen.

His expression was serious as if he was holding the greatest treasure.

Xiao Chen felt a strange feeling in his heart. 

The man’s posture is too ambiguous, and even his eyes were so gentle.

When Xiao Chen thought so, his heart beat even faster.

The man stood up only after he had put on the shoes.

Xiao Chen was a little breathless and barely recovered. With red eyes, he said, “Don’t stay here. I want to go to the toilet.” 

The man did not refute and laughed softly. He looked at Xiao Chen with indulgence as if he was looking at a child. Then, he gently walked around Xiao Chen and went out.

Xiao Chen saw his back as he left and breathed a sigh of relief.

Who the hell is this man?

Xiao Chen’s face was still red from blushing. He took off his pants while he was dazed and lost in his thoughts. 

As a result, his face burned even more.

He had never been in love before, much less kissed, so how did he somehow give his first kiss to a man?

And.

Xiao Chen buried his head. 

And he had an indescribable familiarity with this person, making him subconsciously want to be close to the other. Even if his bare feet were held in the other’s hands, he had no aversion.

Xiao Chen couldn’t help but think wildly. Not long after, the sound of rushing water rang out in the toilet.

It’s suffocating.

The man stood in the doorway, listening to the sounds coming from the toilet, and his gray eyes flashed. 

He was like an aristocrat of the European Middle Ages. His clothes were complicated, but instead of long hair, he wore a meticulous, big back hairstyle, with every strand of hair pulled strictly behind his ears.

He had a demeanor that spoke of elegance and a unique temperament. Even when he just knelt to put on Xiao Chen’s shoes, the whole set of movements was elegant.

“Ta-da.” There was a faint sound of footsteps in the distance.

The man paused and could not help but frown. Subconsciously, he looked back at the door of the toilet and did not say anything. He took a slight step back towards the dark corner mysteriously as he had come. 

He disappeared.

Xiao Chen put on his pants while his heart was still pounding loudly.

He stepped out the door and immediately looked around. After he looked, his expression slightly faltered.

The man is gone! 

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen was even more aggrieved.

I thought he was going to wait for me at the door?

“Little child, such a coincidence. How did you get here? It’s amazing that you can run so far to go to the toilet.” Jin Tiantian hooked her hair with her index finger. Her expression seemed to be concerned, but her tone carried a little suspicion.

It was the three strange people from earlier. 

“……” Xiao Chen is a little crybaby but is not stupid. Just now, he walked so far but did not see the toilet at all. How could he not guess that the other party lied to him? Not to mention that the woman in front of him always exudes malice making him very uncomfortable.

Although the woman did not show malice towards him, he was sensitive enough to feel it.

Seeing that Xiao Chen did not say anything, Jin Tiantian narrowed her eyes and let out a cold hum.

There is something. 

Su Jingxia’s and Jin Tiantian’s brain circuits were on the same line. There was initially a lot of disdain for Xiao Chen, but now there was more suspicion.

It seems that the three had just shared something in Xiao Chen’s absence. Jin Tiantian glared at Xiao Chen and sneered, “Little brother, what crime have you committed?” Xiao Chen frowned.

He did not understand.

The woman leaned against the wall with a somewhat careless expression, “What the three of us have in common is obvious. I’m a fraudster, and he’s a scam bail bondsman.” Jin Tiantian pointed at Su Jingxia. 

Jin Tiantian’s finger turned and landed on the old man just now, that is, He Yili, with a bit of contempt in her tone, “Hmph, as for him, robber.”

With certainty in her tone, she stared closely into Xiao Chen’s eyes, “So what kind of criminal are you?”

After the words, she noticed the shoes under Xiao Chen’s feet. The caution and scruples in her eyes grew more and more.

Xiao Chen was just an ordinary college student and was also a good citizen. How can he be a criminal? 

He glared back at the woman and puffed out, “I’m not!”

Jin Tiantian did not believe him.

In fact, all the people here do not believe him. Xiao Chen doesn’t care whether they believe it or not because what he said is true.

For a moment, the four people were in a deadlock. 

Before Xiao Chen could continue to defend himself, the scene in front of them stunned the crowd.

The corridor they were in was long and dark, and the building was high and was decorated as an ancient castle. Coupled with the lack of lights, they couldn’t even see the ceiling when they looked up, and only the faint moonlight shone in from somewhere. So when a group of dark things rushed out from overhead, everyone was almost caught off guard and didn’t even have time to dodge.

Crows.

Thousands of crows stirred their wings and emitted unpleasant cries. The number of crows was so large that their wings fanned a strong gust of wind. 

“Ahhhhh! Go away!!!” Jin Tiantian screamed out, dodging in disarray. She used her hands to push the densely packed objects that rushed out in front of her.

“Shit, what the hell!” He Yili was so scared that he spoke foul language. The flesh on his stomach also bounced with his movements as he backed up to the side. The crows’ beaks kept pecking at his belly, face, ears……

Su Jingxia subconsciously retreated to the side with a large step. His eyes were stern. He did not hesitate to grab Jin Tiantian, who was very close to him, to block his front in an attempt to let her stop the attack of this group of disgusting things.

While struggling with Su Jingxia’s confinement, Jin Tiantian used her hands to blindly resist the crows, whose mouths kept pecking at her palms. One bite of it was a scarlet red. 

Xiao Chen was far away from them and was standing dumbfounded, watching the scene in front of him. His whole body was frozen in place.

What’s even stranger is that this group of crows is so numerous that they almost cover the entire corridor. Still, a protective shield is automatically formed at a distance of one meter from Xiao Chen. Not a single crow dares to cross it.

Xiao Chen retreated towards the corner, and the crows dodged away along with his pace.

He retreated to the corner, looking bewildered. But before he could make his next move, a pair of hands suddenly wrapped around his waist from behind him. 

Xiao Chen nearly shouted out loud.

“Shh, don’t be afraid.” The voice was soft but powerful.

It was the man just now.

Xiao Chen’s dangling heart inexplicably fell into place. It seems that even he himself did not find that he had a trust in this strange man that was beyond the ordinary. 

“Ahhhhh!” Jin Tiantian let out a heart-breaking scream as if she had been hacked. The cry grew even louder and louder, like that of a female ghost who came to claim life in a movie.

“Help! Help!!” Jin Tiantian’s screams were piercing.

“Get away!” He Yili, on the other hand, was hissing and struggling at the same time. There was absolutely no one who could spare half a heart to pay attention to Xiao Chen’s every move.

The man’s gray eyes calmly watched the scene in front of him because he cared more about this person in his arms than these ants. 

Thinking of this, he lowered his head.

Xiao Chen’s lips were pale. He was obviously scared, and even his hands were trembling slightly.

The man paused for a moment and was a little puzzled. He let go of Xiao Chen’s waist and took hold of the other’s hand, carefully protecting it in his own hand. The two men’s posture was no less ambiguous than it had just been, but even more so.

“Is it cold?” The man held his hands and spoke eagerly. 

Xiao Chen reacted and tried to break free from the man’s embrace but was held tighter by the latter with a frown. Countless thoughts inexplicably flashed through Xiao Chen’s mind, and he said fearfully, “Who are you? Are you a human being?”

The man paused and then rubbed his head against the other’s neck like a dog. Xiao Chen’s body stiffened even more. The man held Xiao Chen while rubbing his neck as if he was pretending to be pitiful, “Yu Mo.”

What?

Xiao Chen was dumb for three or four seconds before reacting to the fact that this was the man’s name. 

But before Xiao Chen could continue to speak, the man had sealed his mouth with a kiss that was hot and dominant. He constantly rubbed against his soft, moist lips.

Xiao Chen subconsciously struggled, but was held down by the man, and was compelled to accept this crazy kiss. This back hugging kiss, the posture made it difficult for Xiao Chen to bear it.

His!

Yu Mo narrowed his eyes with a very satiated expression. 

He did not dare to disregard Xiao Chen’s lips and tongue as if he could not wait to integrate the other party into his own flesh and blood. With undisguised paranoia, he was like a beast devouring its prey and tearing it apart into its belly.

This is his!

It may be that Xiao Chen was uncomfortable and felt wronged that his tears sprang up once again like golden beans.

Yu Mo paused, and his pupils contracted fiercely. He let go of Xiao Chen, with undisguised panic in his eyes, and even his hands and feet were shaken. He shifted Xiao Chen around so that the two could face each other. 

Looking at this wrinkled little face, he was heartbroken. He didn’t know why Xiao Chen suddenly cried out. He swallowed uneasily and said, “Don’t cry, don’t cry.”

When you cry, my heart aches so badly.

I love you.

It’s the kind of love that can lead me to hell. 

It’s the kind of love where you don’t even have to do anything but stand there, and I’ll look at you forever.

It’s the kind of love that will move the sea and mountains when I hear your name.

It’s the kind of love that will make my heart ache even if you just slightly knit your brow.




“Ahhhhh!” Jin Tiantian’s scream suddenly increased by a decibel. The sound was so miserable that it frightened Xiao Chen. It made him tremble with fear that he had even forgotten about crying. 

“………”

“………”

Xiao Chen and Yu Mo stared at each other. Xiao Chen’s eyes were watery, and his eyes were slightly red. He was so aggravated that he skewed his mouth.

Looking at his appearance, Yu Mo had no idea which of his nerves had been poked. His eyes sank, and his voice became a little hoarse, though it sounded slightly sensual, “Don’t cry.” 

Xiao Chen ignored Yu Mo, who instead gently lifted his chin and scrutinized his face. He looked at the tear marks on his face, and his eyes showed unconcealed heartache and pity.

Xiao Chen was stunned by the look in his eyes. There was a kind of unspoken feeling of sweetness around his heart, and it made him feel soft and complicated.

Xiao Chen looked at him this way but was not afraid of him. He inexplicably had an indescribable sense of dependence on the man and said, “Then, don’t kiss me.”

The kiss was even so hard. It was like not having eaten meat, and his lips were the meat repeatedly nibbled on.

Thinking about it, Xiao Chen’s face was a little red.

He also sucked his tongue.

Yu Mo did not make a sound.

Xiao Chen still wanted to say something, but the man suddenly pulled him upright with force, put something around his neck, and then softly said, “Behave.” 

Xiao Chen had another burst of red.

Yu Mo’s eyes turned stern all of a sudden, and he suddenly let go of him. Then, he smiled tenderly at Xiao Chen, took a step back towards the corner, and looked at Xiao Chen’s exquisite and unmistakable face with some reluctance. His figure slowly faded away and finally disappeared in front of Xiao Chen’s eyes.

“Don’t be afraid. I will protect you.”

Xiao Chen heard the man say this to him a second before he disappeared. 

Xiao Chen looked down in confusion at his neck, and there was a scythe-shaped pendant.

For some reason, this pendant was like a magical thing. Xiao Chen felt that it instantly suppressed all the uneasiness about the unfamiliar environment that had risen inside him.

It was also this moment that Xiao Chen felt dizzy, and he even felt his brain twitch violently.

The moment he looked up again, a screen appeared out of thin air in front of him! 

This screen was about the size of an ordinary household television. It was somewhat transparent, like the texture of a projector playing. However, Xiao Chen shuddered with sweat, with his mouth open wide, and his body was trembling uncontrollably.

Why you ask?

Because of the content played on the screen! It is precisely Jin Tiantian, Su Jingxia, and He Yili, the three people struggling in the crows in a miserable state!

This was definitely not a surveillance! 

Xiao Chen forced himself to calm down and made himself continue to watch the screen.

It is actually live!!!

There were rows after rows of words flashing below the screen.

Xiao Chen’s eyesight is excellent, and he can clearly see the screen full of malice. 

[ Passerby23344: Give that bitch a hard peck in the eye, she deserves it!!!

Passerby12456: This live is exciting ah! This is how the bad guys should be punished!

Passerby78778: Hahahaha, I’m so excited about how this group of bad guys will die this time. They should not die too easily. They should be made to suffer worse than death!

Passerby76786: This woman has such a pretty face but is a snake beauty! 

Passerby43687155: I’m new here. The comment section is so terrible…

Passerby687723: This man is really ruthless enough to actually take others as a shield.

Passerby38842: This live is more exciting than the previous ah, actually can think of using crows, but how come this group of crows so obedient.

Passerby86754: Isn’t there another person why the camera hasn’t been given to him. 

……………]

Xiao Chen’s hands shook a bit, and his whole body had a cold feeling like being in an ice cellar.

Where the hell is this?

Xiao Chen also noticed that the screen followed the movement of his eyes. He seemed to think of something and immediately clutched the necklace that the strange man had just hung around his neck. 

Who is he?

The moment the man disappeared, the dense crowd of crows seemed to have sensed something. Just like when they came, they flew like a gust of wind to the ceiling in a swarm. There were so many that it was sickening.

The moment the crows all disappeared, Xiao Chen then saw the other three people’s tragic situation.

Jin Tiantian had fallen to the ground with weak knees and was in a terrible state. The agonizing cries of pain did not stop because of the disappearance of the crows. The bloody hands that were pecked by the crows were pressed tightly against her right eye, but the blood still did not stop and flowed out even more. Her wrists and chest were all red, and she was unable to see straight. 

Her eye was pecked away by a crow!

“Ahhhhhhhhh.” She knelt on the ground in pain.

[ Passerby567554: This picture is disgusting…

Passerby785785: Kill her! Quickly kill her! ] 

However, Jin Tiantian could not see this. She pressed down on her injured eyes. She raised her head sharply and looked in the direction of Su Jingxia.

Su Jingxia looked messy, but there was nothing too bad. His clothes and hair were in a mess, and his face had several wounds left by crows, but compared to Jin Tiantian, it was a little better.

Su Jingxia looked at Jin Tiantian, who he had just grabbed as a shield. His eyes were indifferent, and he did not look the least bit guilty. He even hooked the corners of his mouth coldly, somewhat sarcastically.

Jin Tiantian stood up immediately and even forgot to cover her eyes to stop the bleeding. She rushed directly at Su Jingxia, reached out to his face, and slapped him. 

Xiao Chen was startled.

The sound was so loud, and Su Jingxia’s face immediately had a mark, and it even turned red and swollen. Jin Tiantian looked a bit scary, like an evil ghost crawling out of hell. Her body was covered with wounds, and her clothes were bloodied. Her right eye was hollow and empty, and she resembled a skeleton. The blood flowed directly down her face, and there was a kind of scary feeling like bleeding from seven orifices, which was incredibly horrifying.

[Passerby867554: Hey, the eyes are too disgusting! Let her die quickly! Eww!

Passerby767933: Will bleeding so much drain and kill you? 

Passerby542336: I feel some pity for this woman… Isn’t that fat guy so horny at the beginning? I can’t believe he didn’t save her…]

The beauty of Su Jingxia’s celebrity-like face was directly destroyed because of the slap. Jin Tiantian did not seem to be relieved and intended to continue to do something to him. Still, she forgot that Su Jingxia not only has the advantage of gender, his strength and height are much stronger than hers. She was also injured, so how could she be better than Su Jingxia?

Su Jingxia was utterly pissed off with Jin Tiantian. Like Jin Tiantian, he slapped her directly on the face, and Jin Tiantian was knocked to the ground because of the slap’s impact. The blood in her eyes flowed more quickly and fiercely, and it was even more disgusting and terrifying.

But Su Jingxia did not let her off lightly just because of this slap. Like a furious lion, he rushed up and grabbed Jin Tiantian’s hair. 

Jin Tiantian immediately let out a frightening scream, which was so piercing that it could almost shatter the eardrums.

Su Jingxia pulled Jin Tiantian’s hair, dragged her to the ground, and yanked her toward the corner. His actions were incomparably rough, just like a madman.

Jin Tiantian was scared and looked towards He Yili, shouting, “Save me save me!!!”

He Yili was squatting on the side, watching the drama with an indifferent face. He seemed to have a lot of injuries on his body as well. Though it was not as bad as Jin Tiantian, the injuries were also severe. In particular, his signature big belly, which was fat and thick. It was unclear whether the crows were interested in his stomach, but his clothes were full of blood, so it was expected to be not much better. 

His gaze met with Jin Tiantian, and his eyes were cold and ruthless.

Su Jingxia pulled out a bloodthirsty smile, tugged Jin Tiantian’s hair, and lifted her body. Then with a stern look in his eyes, he fiercely grabbed Jin Tiantian’s head and slammed it against the wall.

Not just one blow, and not two or three.

Su Jingxia has gone mad and was completely venting his anger by grabbing Jin Tiantian’s head and slamming it against the wall as if he was desperate. 

“pong!!!”

“pong!!!”

One after another.

[ Passerby67867: Smashing beautifully, we must teach her a lesson! 

Passerby645465: Shit, the image is too bloody. I’m still eating.

Passerby478555: It feels so painful…

Passerby826413: This man is a pervert, right? ]

Xiao Chen’s body was trembling badly at the side. 

The scene was too bloody. The series of actions just happened so fast that he didn’t even react. By the time he even realized what was going on, Jin Tiantian was already smashed numerous times by Su Jingxia, who dragged her to the corner.

“pong! pong!!!”

The blood on the wall is accumulating, and even the wall has a dent. One can fully imagine how much force Su Jingxia used.

There was a shape of Jin Tiantian’s head on the wall. Even her teeth were shattered because Su Jingxia’s force was too strong. 

There is no telling how long it took. Only the sound of the banging can be heard in the air one after another pong.

Even if Jin Tiantian’s brains were smashed out, he did not give up and continued to attack.

Xiao Chen could not hold back any longer. He turned around and started dry heaving against the wall.

Xiao Chen felt a pair of hands on his back. He immediately shivered and subconsciously tried to avoid them. 

But those hands deliberately caressed his back, as if they were soothing him.

The next thing he heard was someone coming up to his ear and saying, “Don’t be afraid.”

Xiao Chen paused. Isn’t this the voice of the bastard who just kissed him? He can’t be mistaken.

Xiao Chen turned around, but no one was there except Su Jingxia, who was still smashing Jin Tiantian on the wall, and He Yili, who was at the side watching coldly. 

Xiao Chen was so scared that he curled up into a ball again.

It is unclear if someone let out a sigh, but Xiao Chen felt the hands begin to pat and caress his back again gently.

There is no telling how long it took before Su Jingxia finally stopped his actions and casually threw Jin Tiantian’s body on the ground. Jin Tiantian’s face can no longer be considered a face anymore. It was completely bloody and blurred. It is impossible to distinguish the features and is more like a blood cake, with the face flattened.

Su Jingxia’s hands and clothes were stained with Jin Tiantian’s blood, but he looked like he didn’t care, wiping his hands on his clothes. He indifferently looked at Jin Tiantian’s corpse and moved his head; his neck made a sound of bones cracking. 

“Heh.” Su Jingxia let out a cold laugh.

He Yili was pondering on the side.

In the next second, Xiao Chen just turned around, and his gaze met He Yili’s cold eyes.

“………” 

Xiao Chen wore white pajamas. One can tell at a glance whether he was injured or not. Not to mention the blood, the clothes were not even dusty, and they were as clean as newly bought clothes. His hair hung down smoothly on his sides, and his two eyes were wet from being frightened by the crows. Like a well-protected little prince in an ancient castle, he was very delicate and made people feel protective of him.

Just now, so many crows came out to attack people but did not hurt him. He can still stand intact and watch the drama. Also, when he said he was going to the toilet, Jin Tiantian specifically pointed him in a direction opposite to the one they were walking in, but this guy suddenly appeared here again. Something is not right at all.

–


He Yili’s eyes flashed, revealing some danger. He stood up straight as if ready to do something. 

Xiao Chen swallowed a mouthful of saliva, his hands were shaking uncontrollably, and he almost had tears flowing out of his eyes in the next second.

This place is too scary.

In the next second, Xiao Chen’s slightly trembling hand was held by a pair of large, cool hands. Xiao Chen paused, and he could not see anyone around him.

But there is no doubt that he knows who this person is. 

Perhaps because of being held by someone’s hand, Xiao Chen’s heart is still nervous, but not to the point of fear.

He Yili seems to be ready to walk in the direction of Xiao Chen. His eyes fixed on Xiao Chen from the beginning to the end, and his feet moved with him.

But before he could do anything, the older man’s originally clear and cunning eyes suddenly went into a trance for three seconds. His whole body was stuck in place like a computer crashed, and he stood there in a strange posture. If it weren’t for the fact that at this moment, all the cameras of the live broadcast fell on Su Jingxia, there would definitely be people who could see that He Yili was different.

But this can only be if.

After ten seconds of weirdness, He Yili’s stiff neck moved, and his eyes fluttered a bit, as if he had a big dream, making him a bit disoriented.

This sense of distortion made him feel that something had been pulled out of his head.

His eyes once again met with those of Xiao Chen, who had been watching him while squatting on the ground.

When Xiao Chen was looked at with some numbness in his scalp, He Yili just glanced at him and leaned his entire weight on the wall nearest to him. Then, he glanced at Su Jingxia, who was erratic in the madness on the side. He looked as if he did not care about anything. 

Xiao Chen’s initially accelerated heartbeat slowly calmed down. The hands that were holding him were still clutching him tightly, and he breathed a sigh of relief and said carefully and softly, “Thank you.”

Except for that somewhat mysterious man, no one would help him.

He was also thankful that there was such a presence to protect him in the dark.

Including the screen he could see, he knew it could never be a coincidence that after the man put on the necklace for him, he had this magical ability, so he knew it was all the man helping him without a doubt. 

“Hmm.” Xiao Chen heard that voice right next to his ear, and the distance from his ear maybe just a few centimeters. It caused Xiao Chen to have a tingling sensation, giving him the illusion that his ears got pregnant.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen’s face reddened a bit again.

The man saw the redness that appeared to be on Xiao Chen’s face, and the next second, his eyes seemed to flash something.

“Sh*t, there are people here.” A figure suddenly popped up in the corridor corner. The man who made a noise saw the outline of a few bodies in the distance and called out. 

However, because they were too far away, they could not see too well. They could only confirm a few people in the area, and they could not see Jin Tiantian’s bloody corpse on the ground.

Two men and a woman followed him, and with the addition of Xiao Chen and the rest of them, there were eight people in total.

Xiao Chen looked over immediately after hearing the shout of alarm.

Those four people slowly came towards their position. 

The man who just started talking is called Li Gou Dan. He can be considered a strong man with well-developed pectoral muscles, and he looks very manly.

When the four people’s footsteps came halfway, only then did they finally see the scene thoroughly.

Li Gou Dan cursed out almost at the same time, “F*ck.”

The four people’s faces were sunken, complicated, somewhat ugly, but the reaction can still be considered very calm, not like an ordinary person who has never seen a dead person. There was no sign of vomiting and fainting at the sight of a corpse. There was not even a scream of fear. 

In this short minute, Xiao Chen had mixed feelings, and his heart turned a thousand times. He cries a lot, and he is delicate, but his IQ does not imply that he is a stupid person.

Combined with the live broadcast page that only he could see and the criminal theory that Jin Tiantian had told him initially, he almost guessed that this place could be some punishment game.

Drop the prisoners here and torture the group to death.

But in addition to Xiao Chen, who was constantly examining and speculating, another person whose face changed when he saw Xiao Chen and the others and began to observe. 

Xu Caitong’s expression was unpleasant, as if he had eaten shit.

What’s going on? How come there’s one more person this time!

To put it nicely, he is a sanctioner in this crazy live game. He is actually an undercover agent infiltrating in the middle of this group of murderous devils.

A live broadcast, a game, a sanctioner, and six murderers. His task is simple: he has to lure these people, give them some guidance, destroy their psychological construction, and let this group of people attack one another. He just needs to lead them to those dangerous places, and they will naturally be tortured to death. This is so he can stage a bloody and cruel killing game in front of the audience. 

Xu Caitong discovered that there was one more person, and another one had actually been killed before he could find them. He could not help but curse in his heart, but in order not to reveal his identity, he had no way to contact the people above him to ask for specifics directly. Therefore, even though he had a million doubts in his heart and a million grass mud horses, he could only hold it in.

He looked at the corpse of a woman whose face was completely smashed on the ground, and Su Jingxia, who was covered in blood and looked a little crazy. He also looked at the older man, who looked a little indecent, and Xiao Chen, who was squatting in the corner. Then, he made a preliminary judgment on these people.

When Xu Caitong saw Su Jingxia for the first time, he did not hesitate to pull this person into the blacklist in his heart.

This man is by no means a fuel-efficient lamp. He is very dangerous, and it is best to get rid of him early. 

As the only woman still alive in the room, Yang Ru is not the same type as Jin Tiantian. She has a sharp, short haircut and is quite tall, probably taller than Xiao Chen, who is only 178 cm tall in height. She has a square face shape, single eyelids, and has an inexplicable supermodel temperament.

When Yang Ru saw Jin Tiantian’s corpse, she couldn’t help but squeeze her fingers tightly, glanced coldly at Su Jingxia, and narrowed her eyes.

Xiao Chen can feel that this woman seems to hold a kind of hostility towards those men who make a move on women as if seeing a natural enemy.

Yang Ru snorted coldly and didn’t say anything. 

[ Passerby5344796: The people are finally all together, and they can almost directly enter the main show, right?

Passerby 5542697: This time, it’s Xiao Xu who is leading the team again. He is definitely the most handsome of all the sanctioners.

Passerby43398: Hey, what’s the use of looking good? Watch out if he doesn’t get someone else killed, but instead, he gets killed by others.

Passerby423668: The upstairs has not seen Xu Caitong’s live, right? He has a high IQ and max force value, do you know? At least a quarter of this live room are his fans, right? ] 

Seeing that the live room is almost on the verge of arguing, Xiao Chen, with sharp eyes, noticed the words ‘Xu Caitong’ flashing in the live room.

His suspicions deepened, and before he could sort it out, he saw a man suddenly stand out.

Xu Caitong directly stepped forward, his voice was not too loud, his appearance was somewhat elegant, and he said with a questioning tone, “I am Xu Caitong, I don’t know what you guys call yourselves?”

He Yili snorted, patted the fat on his stomach with his hand, and said with carelessness, “I’m He Yili.” 

Su Jingxia took off his coat and held it to wipe his hands. The actions were very careful and serious. The original bloodthirsty and crazy expression was all withdrawn at the moment of the stranger’s arrival as if Xiao Chen had not watched him go berserk and kill. It must have been easy to be deceived by his handsome and profound face. It was especially so when he was standing in front of Jin Tiantian’s corpse at this moment, carefully and seriously wiping the blood from his body with his clothes. There is no way to describe the eerie feeling of the picture.

Su Jingxia raised his head, the corners of his mouth rose slightly, and his eyes met Xu Caitong’s gaze, the latter felt a chill as he was stared at.

This was definitely the toughest criminal he had ever encountered since he joined!

“I’m Su Jingxia.” The man sneered, seemingly not putting this group of people in his eyes. 

For a while, all eyes were placed on the poor and helpless Xiao Chen, squatting on the side.

“………”

“I’m Xiao Chen.” Xiao Chen’s voice was a little soft, and he looked like he was bullied. Perhaps it was because he was scared by the bloody scene just now, but there were still tears in the corners of his eyes.

Easy to bully and nonthreatening is basically the first impression everyone has of him. 

The moment Xu Caitong said his name, Xiao Chen’s gaze was completely locked onto this person, especially when the screen that he couldn’t ignore even if he wanted to, was constantly swept by the words ‘Xu Caitong’. As he looked at Xu Caitong, his eyes became even more strange.

However, Xu Caitong could not understand his feelings and did not know what Xiao Chen had in mind.

Xu Caitong nodded, and several other people behind him began to introduce themselves in turn.

“Li Gou Dan.” 

“Yang Ru.”

“Zhang Guangjun.” The man was bald.

There was an eerie silence for a while.

Li Gou Dan directly broke this silence by opening his mouth and asking, “Have you observed anything in this area? Do you know where this place is?” 

Su Jingxia has finished wiping his hands, and almost without hesitation, he threw the expensive-looking piece of clothing that he had wiped his hands with on Jin Tiantian, “We’ve been looking around here for a long time and haven’t found anything. We don’t even know where this place is.”

The tone was light and indifferent.

Li Gou Dan seems to have confirmed something. His character seems to be quite cheerful. He doesn’t seem to mind Su Jingxia’s alienation from him, nodded his head, and said, “It seems that we all appeared here for no reason.”

However, under this calm surface, is that he completely ignored the bloody corpse. He did not open his mouth to ask questions, which added to the sense of weirdness. 

At least the only little pitiful Xiao Chen here thinks so.

Xu Caitong opened his mouth at the right time and said, “In that case, why not team up and take a look around? Maybe we can find some clues.”

Xiao Chen had stood up, and he almost subconsciously hid his hand behind him, afraid that others would see that his hand was making a handshake gesture out of thin air.

But if you’re afraid of being noticed, you should just let go now. It is unknown what Xiao Chen is thinking, but in any case, the man’s mood feels pleasant because Xiao Chen has been holding his hand tightly back. 

The man’s gaze fell on Xiao Chen’s pink earlobe, which looked like a delicious dish that he had been thinking about for a long time. This dish is full of color and flavor, placed there to bring him full temptation. Finally, he did not resist and did not know where to get the courage. He always felt that Xiao Chen could not refuse him, as in the previous times he kissed Xiao Chen without asking the other’s opinion. This time he could not ask, thinking he was close to Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen could feel a body coming to his side and didn’t think much about it, and in this case, he didn’t have time to overthink.

The next thing he knew, he felt his earlobe wrapped in something wet and soft.

“………” 

？？？？？



Along the way, the entire team’s atmosphere was very secretive, and no one made a sound. The people were separated from each other by at least 30 to 40 centimeters, and everyone’s expressions were very restrained. They observed the surroundings and people with hidden wariness in their eyes. 

On the contrary, Su Jingxia, who just killed someone, had a more lazy expression, which just looked weird and creepy.

To think about it, this group of people have known each other for no more than a day, not to mention, they have their own thoughts and are not good people.

Xiao Chen was like a silly white boy, following behind them with a dumbfounded expression.

The only thing that made him dissatisfied was that the man just put his hands on him for no more than two minutes, and then there were all kinds of kissing, hugging, and rubbing. It was almost like he was stuck to Xiao Chen’s body. 

So Xiao Chen did not have the heart to pay attention to why the surrounding atmosphere was so weird, and he did not even care to read the comments on that screen.

Xu Caitong has been walking in the forefront from the beginning, and when he stopped, everyone else halted.

Xiao Chen paused and looked up.

In front of them is a wooden door, the height of which can not be seen. Just as they can not see the ceiling and do not know how high it is, the carved wooden door’s height is also unknown and even gives a feeling of darkness.

The door does not look old, but clean like a new door. The pattern on the door is very complicated like an artwork carved out by a knife. Not to mention the color used to paint, which gave people an indescribable sense of contradiction, like there is something dangerous inside.

Seeing this, He Yili directly took one of the only two lamps in the team and slowly approached this door. He carefully examined the pattern on the door and sniffed the smell of the wooden door.

He frowned as he thought of something.

He stood up straight, looked around, then opened his lips and said, “Are you cold?” 

No one answered the question. To be precise, nobody understood how he came up with this sentence out of nowhere that did not fit the context, so nobody paid any attention to him. He Yili was not discouraged and could even say that he did not care at all, so he continued to talk freely. “Logically speaking, it is summer, and the temperature should be very high, but the temperature in this huge space has been very low, especially the more we go inside here, the colder it gets. Have you not noticed that the humidity here is very heavy? Even the back of this door is emitting the smell of humidity.”

“But,” his eyes flickered, and his expression was cautious, “in a place where the moisture is so heavy, this wooden door surprisingly has no trace of decay at all…don’t you think it’s strange.”

[ Passerby656476: A group of idiots, why are they starting to study a door.

Passerby698534: Hurry up and go in, go in, and the show will begin. 

Passerby987698: That kind of thing living inside, of course, the humidity is high, haha.

Passerby897564: Finally made it here. I’ve been waiting for half a day, hurry up. ]

Xiao Chen looked at the comments and immediately became wary.

There was something dangerous inside. 

Xiao Chen’s gaze subconsciously landed on Xu Caitong, who had been walking in the front to lead the way, but at some point had retreated to the end of the line.

Xiao Chen looked over almost simultaneously, and Xu Caitong’s gaze met Xiao Chen’s probing look. The unconcealed suspicion in Xiao Chen’s eyes first startled him. Still, in the next second, he immediately pulled out a seemingly friendly smile, narrowed his eyes, and withdrew his look. He then made his suggestion seemingly unintentionally, “Why don’t we have someone explore the area first?”

When Xiao Chen heard these words, his eyes widened, and he immediately had a bad premonition.

As expected, the corners of Xu Caitong’s mouth rose, and his gaze fell on Xiao Chen. He said in a tone that appeared to be consultative, “Little friend, what do you think?” 

At once, all eyes fell on Xiao Chen. Everyone’s expression was cold and indifferent, and this expression remained surprisingly consistent with pretty much everyone.

Xiao Chen’s heart stopped abruptly for a moment. Even if he stood there, it gave him a feeling of sitting on pins and needles.

They were forcing him to make a decision!

You have to enter even if you don’t want to! 

As if something was stuck in his throat, Xiao Chen did not say a word of rebuttal or refusal for a while. Xiao Chen closed his eyes, cold sweat flowed down from his forehead, and his breathing became a bit rapid. As if he had made up his mind, he moved his lips, but before he could speak, he felt a hand fall on top of his head and then gently touch his hair as if to comfort him. It was this action that swallowed back the words that had run to his mouth.

The man blew the tip of his ear and said in a soft voice, “Don’t be afraid, go in.”

The man’s gaze passed through Xiao Chen and landed on Xu Caitong’s body. Xu Caitong was staring at Xiao Chen with malice in his eyes. The man sneered, and his gaze was heavy.

Xu Caitong inexplicably felt suffocated, like a prey being targeted by a hunter, and was a little alarmed for no reason. 

Xiao Chen exhaled when he heard the man’s words, and his whole body relaxed.

He trusted the man. Since the man said so, then there is certainly no problem.

The next second, almost without hesitation, Xiao Chen glanced at Xu Caitong. Xu Caitong remained standing at the same place and showed him a smile. Xiao Chen walked directly to the front of the team. He Yili saw this and instantly retreated to the side.

This door appeared to be heavy. Xiao Chen stretched out one index finger tentatively and poked it gently. Before he could exert enough force, this door seemed to be pushed open in a second as if it had been shoved by something powerful. 

“………”

“………”

It was dark inside, darker than outside.

It was the kind of darkness where you can’t even see your fingers. 

Xiao Chen swallowed, took a deep breath, and walked in.

He just took two steps inside when the door seemed to be pushed by someone, emitting a loud “pong” sound as the door slammed shut.

Xiao Chen’s body shuddered, and his heart sank.

Sh*t, it’s so dark. 

“Yu Mo.” Xiao Chen’s voice was a little shaky. He couldn’t see his surroundings, and even more so, he didn’t know what was inside. It was a near-blind experience, and Xiao Chen was so afraid that he spoke to the air.

One second, two seconds, three seconds………

No one responded to him.

Xiao Chen now panicked. In just a few seconds, countless thoughts flashed through his mind like a tumble of clouds, and his body froze in place without making a sound. He did not continue to shout Yu Mo’s name. 

He, was he abandoned?

Xiao Chen’s lips were a little pale.

The man is standing behind Xiao Chen. His eyesight is different from ordinary people’s, so he can see everything around him. From his perspective, Xiao Chen looks like a small hamster hiding in a corner, shivering and obviously scared, but he doesn’t know what to do.

The man who had hoped that Xiao Chen would call out his name a few more times suddenly found that Xiao Chen did not speak anymore. The man immediately had a bad feeling and took a big step forward to Xiao Chen. 

When he saw the expression of Xiao Chen, he could not help but freeze.

He originally thought Xiao Chen would have been scared and cry, but surprisingly, Xiao Chen was like a lost soul standing in place and not talking. If not for his shoulders still trembling slightly and his teeth biting his lips, he would have thought that Xiao Chen was not afraid at all. But it was this expression that made the man feel even more distressed for no apparent reason.

“I’m here.”

Hearing that, Xiao Chen’s teeth released his lips in the next second, and his shoulders even stopped shaking. 

Yu Mo immediately took Xiao Chen in his arms and said in a tone like coaxing a child, “I was wrong, I was wrong, I will never tease you like this again.”

Xiao Chen seemed to finally have a sense of reality. His eyes were stinging, and tears came out as expected. He choked twice, let out a crying hiccup, and then said in a grievous tone, “I thought you didn’t want me anymore.”

Yu Mo looked at this wrinkled little face and heard Xiao Chen’s remarks that were close to a confession of his heart. He was distressed and also delighted and said, “Even if the world doesn’t want you, I couldn’t possibly not want you.”

It was torturous waiting for Xiao Chen to cry enough. Xiao Chen rubbed his face against Yu Mo’s shoulder and said pitifully, “What do I do next?” 

The man released him and said in a soft voice, “Take my hand, I’ll hold you.”

Xiao Chen obediently grabbed the man’s hand. The man smiled and held Xiao Chen tighter.

It was held with great care, and it was like………

It’s like what? It’s like he’s holding the world in his hands, his most beloved treasure. 

Yu Mo has a sense of indescribable satisfaction.

The surroundings were too dark, so Xiao Chen could not see anything and did not know what was around him, but the man could see it clearly.

Two giant pythons were spitting out their tongues. They were as thick as two Xiao Chens, with a length of five to six meters, and their scales were incomparably sharp. The two snakes were intertwined with each other and kept squirming their limbs. Their mouths were wide open, and their saliva flowed down along with its sharp teeth. There were still many snake skins in the whole space, which were from the shedding period.

Of course, in addition to the pythons, there are other things in the room. 

For instance,

Like quite a lot of human corpses, skulls, ribs………

The floor was a scarlet red. In addition to blood, there were already decayed organs. The picture is disgusting and also very frightening and horrifying. All of them are people who have been eaten dead by the pythons.

The man’s expression was indifferent, without the slightest fluctuation. He was not affected at all, as if he had already gotten used to it. 

In fact, the whole space was small. The two people were only a meter away from the pythons. The two pythons were spitting their tongues and drooling, but they never dared to come forward. They could only wriggle their bodies on the ground and looked like they were starving.

Because Xiao Chen could not see, his other senses were amplified, and the rustling sound in the space scared him to get closer to Yu Mo.

The index finger of the man’s other hand pressed against his lips, and his eyes flashed with a warning. His lips moved, but no sound came out.

Shut up, don’t scare my baby. 

The pythons actually stopped their movements, and the sound ceased at the same time.

Xiao Chen eased his breathing and walked carefully with each step, afraid of losing himself in Yu Mo’s side.

Xiao Chen did not know that the live broadcast turned utterly black the moment he entered the room.

[ Passerby 876576: Shit, what the f*ck, the main event, ah, d*mn your black screen! 

Passerby 89768: I’m speechless. I still want to see how the two babies ate the man, f*ck!

Passerby 876566: What the hell, I just entered the live room.

Passerby 987687: Maybe the picture is too gory to broadcast.

Passerby987659: Why can’t it be broadcasted? It’s not like it hasn’t happened before. Speechless. ] 

Yu Mo looked back at the door, and the corners of his mouth rose slightly.

The pythons appeared to have heard some command and stretched its head high. They emitted a creepy light in their eyes, like the exhilaration before a killing spree.

The man sneered.

Since that group of people were so disobedient, they should be punished. 

After all.

The man narrowed his eyes.

The one they wanted to hurt was his baby.



Of course, Xu Caitong knew what kind of beasts lived behind this door. Otherwise, he would not have allowed Xiao Chen to explore the way forward. 

And he has long been prepared.

Thinking of this, he subconsciously gripped the realgar bag in his pocket.

Snakes are afraid of realgar.

This was not the first time he brought people here to offer their heads. He has long been familiar with the two pythons, and basically, two people will be able to fill them up. So, he would let the unlucky one be the appetizer first and then find someone else in the group to get rid of. 

As for who this person is,

Xu Caitong narrowed his eyes and looked at Su Jingxia, who smelled of blood.

He would always stay away from such dangerous criminals and secretly go after them. This person made their own death, so who would blame him?

If not him, who else can it be?

Heh, providence.

But what Xu Caitong did not notice was that after he withdrew his dark and sullen gaze on Su Jingxia, the latter glanced at him with a smirk. His hands were in his pockets, and there was no telling what he was thinking about.

The crowd fell into collective silence at this suddenly closed door.

Zhang Guangjun, the bald man who has little presence, looked a little ugly and said in a not too good tone, “What should we do next?” 

They must enter this door since they have been here for a while. Although there are quite a few rooms in the whole corridor, each room is separate. There are no passages, let alone exits, which meant that this door is their only hope to get out of here, or else they will be trapped.

Seeing that the kid had gone in for ten minutes without a single movement, they could not just stand still.

After all, the time is now short.

There was no food and water, and they were surrounded by a group of wild beasts, without having any idea of what they have in mind. There is more danger if they delay a little more time. 

As soon as Zhang Guangjun thought of this, his stomach untimely issued a grunt.

This sound was extremely abrupt in the quiet environment and woke up the crowd.

“Then why don’t we go in together.” Xu Caitong smiled as he held an oil lamp in his hand. The light of the oil lamp was blown from time to time by the wind that came from who knows where. It swayed from side to side, like dancing in the air. The glow of the candlelight hit his face, and only half of his face was visible. It carried a bit of an indescribable creepiness.

– 

Xiao Chen was nervous and sweated a lot. He didn’t know how long he had been walking, but he was held by the man the whole time, letting the other man do what he wanted.

His exquisite face that seemed unreal was stained with a bit of smoke and dust because of the thin sweat that appeared on it. This look was also a bit more tasteful than the delicate doll-like appearance. Xiao Chen’s face was red and puffy, just like a peach, making people want to take a bite.

The man did not look at the path from the start as he couldn’t stop staring at Xiao Chen’s face. He wanted to put the other person in his pocket for fear of losing him; he was so precious.

The man suddenly stopped in his tracks, and because Xiao Chen could not see, he stumbled into the man’s side, and his body fell forward like a weightless person. 

Yu Mo grabbed the other party’s waist with a swift hand and quickly straightened the other’s stance.

The waist feels very good, and it is not too much to hold.

Yu Mo is a bit reluctant to let go.

“Are we there yet?” Xiao Chen’s voice was soft and sweet, and it sounded very pleasant. 

Yu Mo hooked the corners of his mouth, and he couldn’t hide the pleasure in his tone, “Here.”

After that, the man continued to hold Xiao Chen’s hand. The two of them held hands with their fingers interlinked. It was not a palm-to-palm kind of position, but one where the man had directly wrapped up Xiao Chen’s delicate fingers in his large hand.

Yu Mo looked at Xiao Chen with misty eyes in his arms, looking innocent. He couldn’t help but laugh out loud and then pushed the door in front of him with the hands which had been wrapped around Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen obediently exerted his efforts together. 

The moment the door opened, Xiao Chen subconsciously squinted his eyes. After a long time in a dark environment and now suddenly seeing the light, he was a little uncomfortable.

He subconsciously stretched out his other hand to shield his eyes. He then shook his head several times, blinking hard to adapt to the brightness in front of him slowly. His eyes even squeezed out a few tears from his actions.

It was also when Xiao Chen adapted to the brightness that he finally saw the man’s face clearly.

Compared to seeing it in the dark, Xiao Chen realized that the man’s face was white as if he had not been in the sun. Like a vampire duke who has been hiding in the dark for a long time, his skin showed a pale white color, and his hair hung properly on his sides, slightly curled. His gray eyes only reflected Xiao Chen’s figure alone, and his eyes were a bit upturned. 

Compared to Xiao Chen’s own affectionate phoenix eyes, the angles near the corners of the man’s eyes were sharp and cold-looking. Still, at this moment, his eyes are full of tenderness.

Not knowing if these eyes bewitched him, Xiao Chen’s whole body was frozen in place. His face burst red at speed visible to the naked eye, just like a cooked crayfish.

Yu Mo seems to have discovered a new world, and with a flirtatious tone, he said, “Are you shy?”

“…………” 

I’m not, I’m not, don’t talk nonsense.

–

As soon as Xu Caitong’s words fell, all eyes looked toward him. Xu Caitong had been standing at the end of the line just now. For a while, everyone communicated in a position where they were facing him, and their backs were turned to that gate.

Before the smile on Xu Caitong’s face faded, he suddenly had a sense of foreboding, and the curve of his mouth stiffened and turned into an extremely distorted expression. 

A rustling and grinding sound approached, and it was harsh to the ears. At once, everyone looked at the source of the sound and took two steps back in a defensive posture with a wary expression.

Not good!

Xu Caitong’s heart stopped for a second.

“With a loud “pong” sound, the wooden door was pushed open by a powerful force. 

Two at least half a meter long pythons swayed from side to side in the air. The tips of their tongues resembled scissors; they were scarlet and slender and kept swinging, with a layer of sticky, transparent liquid on top.

The pythons were exposed to the crowd. Before they could get over the shock, the pythons passed their heads right through the door.

“Run!” Yang Ru, the only female in the group, reacted the fastest. She hoarsely yelled as she stared wide-eyed, then ran back as fast as she could, like a cheetah.

Xu Caitong was the second person to react and immediately ran as well. In this short time, all of them darted away with frightened faces. 

But they were still a step too late.

The closest to the door was He Yili, who was a fat man and rarely exercised. His reaction was also half a beat slower than the crowd, so there was no doubt that he immediately became the first victim among the group.

In a matter of seconds, the sharp, knife-like teeth of the python pierced He Yili’s skin, and his blood gushed out violently like a freshly tapped spring. Before He Yili’s wide-open eyes could blink, the python quickly wrapped itself around his body.

He Yili woke up as if he had a dream and used his arms to resist. However, his strength in front of the python was nothing more than a small thing. The python opened its bloody mouth and swallowed him like whole, without even chewing, directly taking He Yili in his mouth. 

The last scene reflected in He Yili’s eyes before he died was the sight of his stomach pierced by the python’s teeth and his internal organs flowing out like free money. This image resembled a market stall selling pork that had not yet had time to deal with the disgusting things.

It is not clear whether the physical quality of the others is really too good. But Xu Caitong, who has already experienced many battles in this place, was soon left behind by this group of people.

Xu Caitong’s heart thumped incessantly, and his eyeballs were protruding because of the horror.

He does not want to die! 

And definitely can not die!

Xu Caitong stared at Zhang Guangjun, the bald man nearest to him. The man also panted heavily and looked horrified. Almost without hesitation, Xu Caitong came up with a way to save himself. He viciously pulled out the dagger used for defense from his pocket and advanced to Zhang Guangjun’s position with the speed of a 100-meter dash.

Anyway, that was not the first time!

Zhang Guangjun heard Xu Caitong’s gradually approaching panting, subconsciously glanced back. 

But Zhang Guangjun was still a step slower, and Xu Caitong pulled out a smile. Zhang Guangjun was stunned as he saw this expression, and his heart pounded harder.

The next second, something stabbed him in the back. Zhang Guangjun opened his mouth wide, his knees weakened, and he fell to the ground directly like a pool of stagnant water, completely unable to move. The bald man could only watch as Xu Caitong put the dagger away and inserted it back into his pocket, then ran away without mercy, leaving him alone behind.

It’s over!

Zhang Guangjun trembled and turned back, the python had already reached him and opened its bloody mouth………… 

[ Passerby875415: Damn, the screen finally resumed, how come it was black for so long.

Passerby897668: How did the pythons come out on their own? They would never step out of their territory before.

Passerby876558: What the f*ck, there are two dead. Is that Xiao Chen dead or not?

Passerby987653: What’s going on with Xu Caitong? This time him leading the team feels terrible and seems to be a mess. He was not at this level before, right? ] 

The breathless people did not know how long they had been running before they finally stopped.

The pythons didn’t follow them either.

Xu Caitong was shocked for a long time and was unable to calm down.

F*ck, what happened this time? 

How come there is one derailment after another? Sh*t.

Before Xu Caitong could sort out his thoughts, Su Jingxia, who had been observing him for a long time, immediately took advantage of his unpreparedness and fiercely bound his hands.

Xu Caitong’s pupils quivered, and his eyes contracted fiercely.

“What are you doing?” Xu Caitong’s voice was a bit shaky, and there was a panic in his tone that could not be hidden. 

The other people looked over at once. They did not see Xu Caitong’s secret dirty work, so in their hearts, compared to the sinister and dangerous Su Jingxia, the gentle-looking Xu Caitong was definitely more trustworthy than Su Jingxia.

This time, the only two remaining people looked at Su Jingxia’s eyes and could not help but be unable to conceal their wariness.

“What am I doing?” The contempt in his eyes could not be hidden as he pulled out a sarcastic smile and narrowed his eyes slightly.

Xu Caitong panicked, his heartbeat instantly accelerated. 

Su Jingxia was incredibly strong. His one hand could easily bind the other’s hands. He didn’t speak but instead went closer to Xu Caitong’s pants and reached directly into the other’s pocket with his other hand.

Xu Caitong stumbled.

It’s over!

Su Jingxia dug in his pocket, and his expression changed. His eyes rolled, and he laughed out coldly, then he smoothly pulled out the bloody dagger that Xu Caitong had just stabbed Zhang Guangjun with. 

Su Jingxia coldly snorted, his voice gloomy.

“Then, you answer first, what is this?”



Xiao Chen returned to his senses with some difficulty. He looked past the man’s figure to observe his surroundings. With a single glance, his mouth opened wide almost subconsciously, and his eyes could not hide his amazement. 

The whole room was vintage with murals in marble. The floor was made of some unknown material that showed a transparent color under the yellow light, flowing like a stream of light.

The crystal chandelier on the ceiling was also very eye-catching. The big red sofas and chairs were made of some kind of wood. They were all meticulously carved and decorated with unique and intricate flowers.

Overall, the whole room looked like it had sprouted from Xiao Chen’s aesthetic, and he liked it very much.

Yu Mo looked at the child whose eyes lit up suddenly and could not help but curve the corners of his mouth. 

At this moment, Xiao Chen discovered that the virtual live screen he just tried to shake off had disappeared.

The man seemed to read his question, and his pale hand touched Xiao Chen’s head, caressing the child’s hair. The touch of his hand was soft, and he took the initiative to say, “It’s just a group of insignificant people, why dirty your eyes.”

A group of ants are just putting on a show.

The man’s eyes suddenly flickered subtly and flashed an incomprehensible stream of light.

Thinking that they are hunters preying, but in fact, there is still someone behind them.

Heh.

Su Jingxia held the bloody dagger, and the corners of his mouth twitched. He opened his mouth to reveal his teeth, with an intoxicated expression as he swept his upper teeth with the tip of his tongue. His eyes turned from side to side, resembling a kind of pervert locked up in a mental hospital. 

Xu Caitong’s cold sweat emerged, and his teeth chattered along.

Su Jingxia put the dagger directly against the other’s neck. The blood on the blade hasn’t been wiped and slid down Xu Caitong’s neck to his collarbone, causing a chilling sensation.

Xu Caitong felt cold all over his body.

At the side, Yang Ru and Li Gou Dan both looked at each other in unison, and a terrible chill rose from the bottom of their hearts. 

Su Jingxia smiled indifferently and used the dagger to pat Xu Caitong’s neck. It was a tease and like a trial before executing a prisoner who was to be beheaded.

Xu Caitong completely lost his voice. It was stuck in the back of his throat.

It was usually him who watched other people perform life and death trials, witnessing the light in those people’s eyes disappear entirely, much like a grasshopper that can only hop twice in helpless despair before dying and then go completely cold.

Who would have thought that today, he would also become an ant under the hands of others? 

“You are the sanctioner in this team, huh.” Su Jingxia said in a calm and dissatisfied tone, without much fluctuation, as if he was talking about a trivial matter that could have been a daily occurrence. The sound of these words does not suggest any questioning, but more like self-affirmation.

However, after finishing this sentence, Xu Caitong’s brain collapsed, and the entire body froze. His mouth moved, but he did not make a sound. His expression was completely distorted, and his eyes were about to burst.

How! How could he know!

Xu Caitong felt the coldness spread from the soles of his feet to his whole body. He could no longer conceal himself and was exposed like a man without clothes under the eyes of Su Jingxia. 

A terrible thought flashed through Xu Caitong.

Could it be! This man in front of me has seen the live broadcast of that particular platform!

If the answer is yes, then he was hiding too deep from the beginning!

Sanctioner 

The two people next to him were bewildered. Still, their intuition told them that everything they had experienced and why they appeared in this hellish place everything was connected to Xu Caitong.

Having just taken back their lives from death, and even seeing with their own eyes the python swallowing a live person who had just been standing right there talking to them, how could they not have a storm inside them!

With this in mind, the two looked at Xu Caitong with a look of unspeakable hatred and resentment.

“You must know the way out. Why don’t you quickly take us out!” Li Gou Dan almost roared out these words, and his eyes were a little red. 

He did not want to die in this hellish place.

Su Jingxia snorted out a laugh at this point. First, it was the kind of muffled laughter emitted from the chest, then it turned into a loud laugh with his mouth wide open, like a clown. His laughter was very piercing, and it made the rest of the three present unable to hold back a shiver.

Xu Caitong opened his mouth and seemed to want to say something. Still, before he could make a sound, he stared at his body like something within was crazy and writhing. Even his muscles began to start aging at speed visible to the naked eye, and all his veins are about to burst up. The hellish thing began to move up from his stomach area, chest, throat………

Xu Caitong’s mouth opened wide uncontrollably, and the taste of blood immediately filled his entire mouth. He foamed at his mouth, and the sound of clacking and swallowing was remarkably abrupt and frightening in this quiet environment. 

Xu Caitong’s bloodshot eyes were about to burst out, and his face flushed red. In the next second, a bloody thing fell out of Xu Caitong’s mouth.

Yang Ru stood very close to him and saw it clearly with a glance.

It’s a tongue!

Xu Caitong’s tongue! 

F*ck!

Compared to the two people whose eyes were about to burst out, Su Jingxia reacted incomparably calmly and even loosened the hands that bound Xu Caitong, who subconsciously locked his hands around his throat the moment he was released, with an expression that he wanted to cough but couldn’t.

Xu Caitong even shoved his fingers into his mouth to induce throwing up and kept gouging his fingers inside. The image was too shocking, and Xu Caitong’s whole body was shivering and squatting on the ground.

This posture remained for about half a minute before Xu Caitong jerked to the side and spurted out a mouthful of blood. Along with the blood, there was also a black creature with a similar appearance to a cockroach. However, this creature was the size of an adult’s palm, black, and hairless. It was covered with sticky liquid that was yellow, red, and food residue from Xu Caitong’s stomach. 

Xu Caitong could no longer make a sound. Li Gou Dan was frantic and rushed up in one big step to grab Xu Caitong’s collar and said anxiously, “Take us out!

But Xu Caitong has completely lost his voice. He stretched out his right hand, trying to struggle, and looked at Su Jingxia on the side with his eyes full of despair. Even his breathing was a little complicated, and his eyes could not hide his hatred, but he was also somewhat pleading.

[ Passerby987634: Hey, Xiao Xu seems to be failing at this one, tsk.

Passerby897634: Sh*t, all of my family members have voted for Xu Caitong, this son of a b*tch. 

Passerby9874396: I have long seen that Xu Caitong could not be relied on. Fortunately, I had the foresight to vote for someone other than him at the beginning.

Passerby437644: Hahahaha, when I saw Su Jingxia killed that woman, I voted for Su Jingxia. It seems that I will win this time! ]

Su Jingxia sullenly held the dagger retrieved from Xu Caitong’s pocket, and his expression changed.

Yang Ru crouched directly in front of Xu Caitong and said anxiously, “Do you know how to get out?” 

Xu Caitong paused at first; his eyes were red and swollen. Then, he reacted and then nodded frantically.

Yang Ru breathed a sigh of relief.

Fortunately.

But what she didn’t see was that Xu Caitong’s eyes were full of malice, not at all like an ordinary person with a stable mind. 

Li Gou Dan pulled Xu Caitong up, held him so that he could stand firmly, and viciously threatened, “You better not play any tricks, or you won’t end up well!

Xu Caitong’s face was pale, and he did not speak. He glanced at Su Jingxia, and his expression became even more ugly.

Yang Ru and Li Gou Dan had many doubts inside, but they both knew that what was more important to them now than the truth was how to escape from this place!

Xu Caitong trembled and pointed his finger in a direction. 

He appeared to be instructing the crowd to go in that direction.

–

In the darkness, something dangerous opened its eyes and turned over. The gray eyes looked around, and it moved its body, which had some muscle atrophy from sleeping too long. Its expression was cold and ruthless.

The man touched his chest, with his fingers on the position of his heart, as if he was feeling his heartbeat. 

The heart hurts, it hurts.

Something is not right!

The man’s eyes snapped wide, like an enraged beast on the verge of eruption.

His baby is gone! 

Where is his treasure?

The next second, his body turned into a distorted black mist with only a barely discernible humanoid outline, then dispersed and completely disappeared into the air.

Yu Mo’s eyes snapped open. His hand exerted pressure and squeezed Xiao Chen’s wrist tight.

Xiao Chen frowned as he looked at Yu Mo, who suddenly became strange. He blinked, pushed his chest, and whispered, “What’s wrong with you?” 

Xiao Chen’s mumbled voice was what pulled Yu Mo back to reality. Yu Mo immediately loosened Xiao Chen’s hand and gently massaged it, “Did I hurt you by squeezing it?”

Xiao Chen suddenly noticed that Yu Mo’s eyes became strange as if he was hiding something.

Xiao Chen shook his head, “It doesn’t hurt.” He was telling the truth.

Yu Mo touched Xiao Chen’s hair, and then both his hands grabbed Xiao Chen’s fingers and carefully protected them. Xiao Chen sat on the chair and stared at Yu Mo with a blank expression. 

Yu Mo squatted down and knelt on one knee, watching every little expression by Xiao Chen with unblinking eyes. The two people’s posture resembled that of a princess and a knight, being pious and protective.

“Baby, you be good and wait for me here. I’m going to take care of some things. I’ll be right back, okay?” Yu Mo half coaxed Xiao Chen with a gentle and doting tone. However, Xiao Chen’s face turned red again due to Yu Mo calling him “baby”. With a flushed face, he muttered with a bit of embarrassment, “Mm.”

Yu Mo smiled and stood up. After taking three steps, he looked back at Xiao Chen, who was sitting on a chair and staring at his little legs with a well-behaved look. Then, he finally disappeared into the hall………

His seal was opened.



‘Ta-da-da‘ drops of water hitting the floor emitted an ethereal sound that pierced one’s ears. The sound was small, but it didn’t seem very pleasant in the quiet environment. 

The man stood in the dark room with a grim expression, his fingers clenched in a fist, and his eyes fixed on the empty bed. There is no telling how long he stood there before taking a step forward and touching the quilt with his palm.

The man’s expression became even colder.

The temperature in the covers has long since cooled down, and it is impossible to guess how long the occupant of the bed has been away.

The man clenched his teeth. 

His baby had been out of this room for at least over an hour!!!

Thinking of this, the man can no longer use words to express his inner anger and urgency.

The man scanned the room’s furnishings and looked very carefully, as if afraid to miss any clues.

But the room was furnished as if it has no owner. It is clean, and there are very few things in the room, making it is impossible to tell anything from it.

The next second, the man’s body turned into a wisp of black smoke, submerged in the darkness, floated in the air, and completely disappeared.

Unless his baby opens the door of this room, no one can enter! No one can enter this space!

Where the hell did his baby go?

What’s worse is that it seems that there is something that has cut off his sense with his baby, preventing him from detecting his baby’s location! 

–

Xu Caitong’s expression throughout the entire time was like a puddle of stagnant water. His face was very haggard and did not have any vitality. He looked like he had aged more than ten years, and his appearance was very different from when they first saw him.

Not only that, the smell of blood on Xu Caitong’s body is very strong, spreading in the air, and was unpleasant to the nose. There was even a foul odor floating around, like the smell of dead fish.

Li Gou Dan frowned in disgust as he was deeply affected before resisting the urge to throw out Xu Caitong. 

On the other hand, Yang Ru looked at Su Jingxia from time to time and had many speculations and judgments in her eyes about this person. She has a strong psychological quality and is not a good person. Still, she has come to this point after being forced out by people, so her defenses were heavier than anyone else’s. And she felt that this man was extraordinarily cold-blooded and dangerous at first sight. If she didn’t have any other choice, she wouldn’t want to have any contact with such a person at all.

Surprisingly, Su Jingxia, who will have a fit and make some strange movements from time to time, did not make a sound this time. His expression was light as he was walking at the side. He was well-dressed, his movements were very reserved, and it was utterly undetectable that he was a madman.

But what everyone did not notice was that there was a black mist wrapped around their heads at some point, following their pace closely.

In the darkness, the man’s attention fell on the one covered in blood and walking at the end, and his eyes instantly lit up. 

He could sense his baby’s breath on this person!

This group of people must have seen his baby!

With this thought, the man’s heart instantly became excited. Even his expression when looking at Su Jingxia took on a bit of heat.

Su Jingxia’s footsteps lagged, and his body stopped in place. Yang Ru first saw his movements, but although a hint of mysterious suspicion arose in her heart, she did not take it too seriously. 

Su Jingxia’s eyes changed directly from clear to cloudy, and his originally expressionless face froze. His brain went into brief shock for a second, and his eyes lost their light. The next second, Su Jingxia, who seemed different, returned to normal and continued to move forward. He didn’t seem to notice that he had just been out of his mind for a while.

The man copied Su Jingxia’s memory and began to reflect on it carefully.

That’s right! It’s my baby!!!

The next second, the black fog slowly dispersed and flew away in another direction, as if it never existed. 

Xiao Chen opened his eyes suddenly and looked around.

He took a deep breath, his eyes still misted and dazed.

He fell asleep at some point while sitting on the chair.

Xiao Chen pressed his temples with his hand, his nerves still in a bit of a trance. 

Why does he always feel as if he has forgotten something very important?

Xiao Chen lifted his head again and stared at the chandelier on the ceiling.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, Xiao Chen slowly moved his gaze to his neck, staring closely at the pendant with a strange shape.

With this in mind, Xiao Chen’s fingers could not help but attach to the pendant and gently feel it a few times. 

There is an indescribable sense of satisfaction.

Not knowing what he was thinking, Xiao Chen hesitated and took the pendant off his neck carefully, holding it in his hand and observing it under the light.

When Yu Mo hung the necklace around his neck, the surrounding area was too dark, and he couldn’t see too well at all.

The pendant was in the shape of a scythe with a simple style, but looking closely, there seems to be some carvings of drawn symbols on it. Xiao Chen touched it, and there was an indescribable feeling to the touch. 

Keke, I finally found you! My treasure!

Xiao Chen’s hand paused, and he blinked innocently, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

Did he just hear something?

Xiao Chen bit his lips. 

That voice was familiar.

Whose does it resemble?

Xiao Chen fell into deep thought, and suddenly, his eyes lit up.

It was Yu Mo’s voice! 

Xiao Chen just came up with an answer, but before he had time to think about it, he was embraced by a slightly cold but broad chest from behind and directly into their arms.

Xiao Chen was shocked as someone suddenly hugged him, and his body trembled uncontrollably.

Xiao Chen’s throat moved. He blinked and carefully looked towards the face of the person behind him. After seeing his features clearly, Xiao Chen slowly relaxed his heart.

Phew.

It’s Yu Mo.

At this thought, Xiao Chen relaxed his body and allowed the other party to hold himself in his arms.

The man was almost a head taller than Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen was sitting on a chair again, and the posture of the two was the man leaning down to enclose Xiao Chen in his arms, along with the chair. The man put his head against Xiao Chen’s neck, his thin lips moved, and his eyes flickered slightly, “Baby, you are not good.”

You actually ran here! 

Xiao Chen turned his head with a confused face and dumbly locked eyes with the man.

The two’s posture is very ambiguous at the moment, especially under the yellow light, they appear more intimate. There is only a distance of a few centimeters between their faces. As long as they come a little closer, they can kiss unrestrainedly.

The man’s gray eyes trembled with the temptation of the beauty in front of him, and the knot in his throat slid as he moved his head, as if he wanted a kiss.

But before he succeeded, a powerful force from behind grabbed him violently by the collar. He immediately let go of Xiao Chen to prevent hurting his baby. As expected, he was flung directly by something with a strong force the next second. But the moment he was thrown away, he turned into a black mist and condensed back into an entity, standing again in the same place. 

Yu Mo took Xiao Chen in his arms, and his gray eyes were so cold that they were almost condensed into ice. His hands were clenched, and his entire body was in a stage of fury as if he would go berserk in the next second. He looked at the man in front of him grimly, just like a lion whose territory had been violated and was ready for a fight to the death.

Xiao Chen’s mouth dropped open, and his gaze went back and forth between Yu Mo and the man’s face a few times in disbelief.

How can there be two Yu Mo?

The man narrowed his eyes and made a move to attack. His aura did not lose Yu Mo, and when the two stood side by side, they looked precisely like they were carved out of the same mold! 

The man thought viciously.

The baby is his!

It was this man who snatched his baby from his side!!!

Yu Mo almost completely furious. He gritted his teeth and said, “Appearing in front of me with this face, do you not want to live anymore?” 

Hearing this, the man snorted and hooked the corners of his mouth. His eyes were disdainful as he shot back, “I found him first! So he’s mine! It was you who took advantage of the situation to take him away from me!”

After the man finished speaking, his eyes became stern. Yu Mo was utterly enraged, his right hand’s five fingers bent like a claw. A black mist emerged from his hand, and he waved his hand in the direction of the man and attacked him.

The man’s eyebrows jumped, and he turned into mist to dodge, narrowly avoiding injury.

From the beginning, Xiao Chen hid behind Yu Mo, speechlessly watching the battle between the two men, inwardly horrified. 

Xiao Chen had already determined who was Yu Mo the moment he spoke. He carefully observed the man who had the same face as Yu Mo and had a strange feeling that he couldn’t explain.

Before Yu Mo appeared, Xiao Chen did take that man as Yu Mo. Still, when these two men stood together, even if their figures and expressions were identical, Xiao Chen found that he could still see the difference between the two!

He can clearly perceive that that person and Yu Mo are definitely two different individuals.

The man’s gray eyes flashed, and he stood still, coldly staring at Yu Mo, without seeming to have the slightest intention of backing down. 

Yu Mo looked at this face that was no different from his own. He frowned and opened his mouth gloomily, “Now, get out!!!” His voice was raised slightly, and when his last word landed, it almost carried an ear-piercing shock.

The man did not speak, nor did he show the slightest look of fear.

Just when Xiao Chen thought that the man was planning to do something, the man only stood still and gave Xiao Chen a deep look. There was a hidden touch in the eyes that Xiao Chen could not understand.

Even Yu Mo did not continue to attack but only coldly stared at the man’s every move, enclosing Xiao Chen in his arms. 

The next second, the man turned into black mist again and completely disappeared from the room.

Xiao Chen watched at the scene in front of him with a dumbfounded face, looked in the direction the man left, and then up at Yu Mo, and was still a little confused.

Yu Mo walked to Xiao Chen, squatted down, and knelt on one knee. It was like a General willingly lowering his noble head and accepting the Emperor’s crowning, just because the one sitting on the throne is the one he loves so much.

Yu Mo leaned over and buried his head in Xiao Chen’s arms. His right ear was close to Xiao Chen’s thigh, enabling him to sense the temperature of Xiao Chen’s body, as well as the faint scent of his body. 

Xiao Chen felt that he should seem to say something, but before he could speak, Yu Mo lifted his own head and tilted it to meet Xiao Chen’s gaze.

From Xiao Chen’s point of view, he was able to see Yu Mo’s Adam’s apple sliding slightly. There was also the looming collarbone and neck and a distinctive pair of gray eyes. And all that was reflected in his eyes was his own lone figure.

Xiao Chen must admit that he was bewitched by the beauty.

Before Xiao Chen could say anything, Yu Mo opened his mouth instead and said in a sour tone, “He hugged you!” 

Xiao Chen felt like an arrow shot through his heart, and there was an indescribable sweetness to it.

Yu Mo’s expression is too cute!!!

Yu Mo buried his head in Xiao Chen’s lap again, looking like he was being pampered. Xiao Chen was amused, and even the words he wanted to ask were dispersed, enjoying the sweetness of the moment.

But what Xiao Chen did not notice was that the eyes of the man leaning on his lap suddenly changed when he could not see, becoming sinister and cold. There was no way to hide his killing intent. 

So!!! He must disappear from this world!!!!




Yu Mo looked down at the young man who had been put to sleep in his arms and laughed softly. 

With the help of his hand, he hugged the child tightly and stood up.

His movements did not awaken the young man. His little head was lying on the spot where his heart was, and he subconsciously used the tip of his nose to gently touch his chest, bringing a tickling sensation.

But it was precisely this action of brushing against his heart that made Yu Mo’s expression suddenly change, and his eyes sank slightly.

If Xiao Chen was still awake, he might have opened his eyes innocently and asked, “Why can’t I hear your heartbeat?” 

The man hugged Xiao Chen more cautiously.

Although Xiao Chen looks very slender, he is still a bit heavy because he is an adult with a height of 178 cm.

The man’s pace was steady from start to finish, and each step was taken with care so that the child could sleep very peacefully.

The man looked faintly ahead, and the scene around him was enveloped in a black mist that began to distort. The next second, the scene changed. The grand living room turned directly into a luxurious bedroom. Even the small lamp above the bed was hung with purple crystals.

Yu Mo gently put the child on the bed. His movements were very light and slow, full of tenderness and love.

With a wave of his hand, the man produced a bed quilt and took off Xiao Chen’s shoes in a fluid manner. He covered him with the quilt and adjusted the pillow so that he could sleep comfortably.

The man remained in a standing position at the head of the bed, staring longingly at Xiao Chen’s sleeping face, without making a sound.

There is no telling how long he stood, perhaps more than a quarter of an hour, and the man did not even blink. 

The gray eyes are filled with ripples of love and affection that cannot be hidden.

Finally, the man’s legs moved. He turned around and disappeared from the room.

All the surrounding lights went dark at the same time in this instant.

It has returned to darkness and silence again. 

The pitch-black corridor, the lack of daylight, and the unknown hours of walking, coupled with the various physical needs, wrecked Li Gou Dan’s nerves little by little.

Finally, he could not stand it any longer, and his face reddened with impatience because of the suffocation.

On the way, he was the one who supported the sick Xu Caitong. Yang Ru only occasionally came over to give a hand, while Su Jingxia was completely unconcerned in the back. In this way, how can he balance his mind?

Why should he be the only one who is exhausted? 

“Fuck. “Li Gou Dan cursed and screamed, and suddenly let go of Xu Caitong. His nostrils flared with annoyance.

Xu Caitong lost support and fell directly to the ground.

Xu Caitong showed a painful expression as his two hands supported himself, and the fishy taste in his mouth was getting increasingly stronger.

“What are you doing! “Yang Ru’s eyes widened. 

Xu Caitong was now their only hope to get out!

Li Gou Dan didn’t even pay attention to Yang Ru. Instead, he grabbed Xu Caitong’s collar and forced him to the corner, angrily questioning, “Are you playing with us! Do you know how to get out or not?”

Xu Caitong spewed a mouthful of blood because of Li Gou Dan’s movements. Li Gou Dan was unprepared, and his whole face was sprayed with Xu Caitong’s blood. The blood even spurted into his mouth because Li Gou Dan had his mouth open.

The smell of blood. 

Li Gou Dan’s eyes widened, and he subconsciously stretched out his hand, wanting to hit Xu Caitong with a slap. However, it may be that his brain suddenly woke up, and he held himself back stiffly.

Xu Caitong pulled out a sarcastic smile, and his eyes were full of unwillingness and regret.

How can he be willing! He had come this far with great difficulty!

All his previous work is lost! It was a waste of effort! 

But his physical condition and even his brain were clearly telling him that he was going to die!

Xu Caitong’s bloodshot eyes met with Li Gou Dan’s angry gaze.

The next second, Xu Caitong laughed loudly and wildly. Even his laughter trembled with despair, powerlessness, and pain.

But this laugh was very unpleasant to hear, and it was more like crying than laughing. 

Yes, Xu Caitong no longer has a tongue!

He can’t even speak! How could he be able to laugh well?

But Xu Caitong’s laughter did not last long and soon stopped. Li Gou Dan looked at him with a puzzled face, as if afraid he would play any tricks.

Xu Caitong’s eyes widened, and he smiled as he looked at Li Gou Dan with a playful face, moving his mouth but not making a sound. 

Li Gou Dan frowned in confusion. He does not know how to read lips!

But Xu Caitong’s next move completely stunned the crowd. Xu Caitong violently pushed Li Gou Dan away with one force, as if using all his strength!

Before Li Gou Dan could make the next move, Xu Caitong trembled, reached into his shirt’s inner pocket, and took out something.

Yang Ru and Li Gou Dan were simultaneously on guard, not knowing what Xu Caitong was up to. 

Xu Caitong’s gaze directly ignored the two. Instead, it focused on Su Jingxia, who stood aside the entire time without the slightest fluctuation in expression. The latter stood tall and looked at him directly, with a cold and ruthless look, just like the owner of these eyes.

Xu Caitong smiled mockingly.

He admits that he has lost.

With a tilt of his head, he swallowed what was in his hand. 

It was poison.

Seeing this, Yang Ru thought that it was not good. She rushed up, cupped Xu Caitong’s chin, and said anxiously, “Not good! He wants to commit suicide!!!”

Yang Ru was determined and put her hand directly into Xu Caitong’s mouth, trying to induce him to vomit.

But it was still too late! 

Xu Caitong’s eyes closed, his body immediately went limp and fell to the side without support.

Li Gou Dan trembled and went forward to put his hand on the tip of Xu Caitong’s nose to feel the other party’s breath.

There was no breathing.

Dead. 

“Fuck,” Li Gou Dan was furious. He clenched his fingers into a fist and smashed it directly into the wall.

Yang Ru gritted her teeth.

Xu Caitong is dead. How can they get out?

Su Jingxia’s expression didn’t even waver after seeing Xu Caitong die. 

When the remaining two people were in complete despair, Su Jingxia suddenly moved to Xu Caitong’s body and squatted down.

Yang Ru and Li Gou Dan looked at him with a confused look.

But the next moment, the two were surprised by Su Jingxia’s action.

Su Jingxia took out the dagger from Xu Caitong’s pocket and stabbed it towards Xu Caitong’s heart without hesitation. The body, which had not yet gone cold, instantly stained the ground red. 

“What are you doing?” Li Gou Dan was stunned.

Su Jingxia stood up expressionlessly. His voice had no fluctuations as he coldly said, “Making sure he is really dead and not faking it.”

Yang Ru instantly felt a bad chill.

Even Li Gou Dan’s mouth opened wide as a wave of coldness hit him. 

Su Jingxia lifted his gaze, and the corners of his eyes rose slightly. His expression was serious, and it was unclear what he was thinking about.

Su Jingxia could read lips and understood Xu Caitong’s last words before he died.

Xu Caitong said.

Only one of you is destined to get out alive. 

Heh.

Yu Mo looked at the man in front of him, who looked exactly like himself, with a cold face.

Unwilling to show weakness, the two men stood facing each other, which would give the illusion of looking in the mirror.

In the dark, two figures were shrouded in black without any trace of light on their bodies, as if they should have been one with the darkness. 

When a king sees a king, one of them must die.

The man took the lead in breaking the eerie silence. His voice was undisturbed, and his angular face carried no emotion. His lips moved, and he said coldly, “This day has come.”

Yu Mo did not speak. His eyes narrowed slightly as though he was preparing for an attack.

The man took a few steps forward, shortening the distance between them. He stared at Yu Mo’s gray eyes, stating the facts without emotion, “You want to kill me, right?” 

Yu Mo still did not say anything.

The man just calmly looked at Yu Mo’s eyes, “I also want to kill you.”

It’s funny. They have the same memories, the same hatred for the world, and the same tragic past. They should be working together, but they are in love with the same person. Despite being one with each other, the sinful factor inside them is screaming with madness, jealousy, and hatred.

Baby should belong to me! No one can take him away from me! 

Because they are the same, they are destined to be incompatible with each other.

However, Yu Mo was not angered by his words, and his expression was bland. The man was somewhat confused when he saw this.

This was the first time he felt he couldn’t read his other self.

What the man did not know was that Yu Mo possessed more than just the memories they shared. There were more truths about the world that he had not discovered. 

After awakening, of course, Yu Mo could not fight with his other self.

Because he knows better than anyone that if one of them dies, then the other one can’t possibly live either.

This is the trap set for them in this world by the Heavenly Dao. As in every world before, it is trying to destroy himself and Xiao Chen by all means.

Yu Mo said, “You have not thought that between us, besides the death of one side and the other alive, there can still be other options”. 

The man paused, and his gray eyes flashed along.

–

Xiao Chen felt his brain was heavy as he was dizzy from having a long dream.

He dreamt that he had gone back to the age of eight, to the village that he felt was a nightmare, and to a past that he was afraid to face. 

“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!” Some of the villagers were holding knives. Some carried the tools they usually used in their work, and others were raising torches. The expression on each of them was so hideous, just like a madman, bloodthirsty, cold and ruthless.

All of them had the same expression, with their eyes almost popping out. In the darkness, the spectacle was overwhelmingly shocking. All of them were shouting the same chant, as though they had been brainwashed, but their expressions couldn’t hide the excitement.

Xiao Chen hid in the grass, looking at the scene in front of him with a timid expression.

He secretly followed along. He didn’t know what these people were doing or what they wanted to do. He just felt that all these usually familiar faces had become so strange one after another. 

Xiao Chen straightened his neck to see farther, so he could watch what terrible rituals were going on in the center of the crowd. Just listening to the ear-splitting shouts around him, he had a chill like falling into an ice cellar.

Xiao Chen could only be dazed to see someone dancing barefoot in the center of the crowd. His face was painted ghastly white with something unknown, and he was holding a bowl in his hand. He chanted some incomprehensible incantation, which was the same as the action Xiao Chen usually sees when the villagers sacrifice to the mountain gods.

It may be that the ceremony was too long that Xiao Chen did not know when he fell asleep while hiding in the grass. When he woke up again, the villagers had long since disappeared.

Xiao Chen carefully crawled out of the grass. His face and clothes were covered with dirt and mud, so he was in a mess. 

It may be due to the playful nature of children. He saw from afar that the villagers just stood at the location of a large black mass. Because it was night, he did not see it very well, so he was not afraid and went straight over.

It was actually a person.

Xiao Chen stared wide-eyed, stunned by the scene in front of him.

Lying on the ground was a boy who appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years old. The boy’s upper body was covered in blood, his face was very pale, and his hands were spread out. He was lying on the ground in a wide-open position. 

This was undoubtedly not what shocked Xiao Chen the most. It was the fact that the boy’s heart was gouged out of him, and a bloody hole was left in his chest while his heart was just thrown next to him. All in all, it was a very shocking and frightening image.

Suppose it was a twenty-year-old Xiao Chen who saw this scene. In that case, he might be able to figure out that the villagers were performing a ritual called Sky Burial, where the bodies are left in the middle of nowhere for the beasts and birds on the mountain to devour.

But unfortunately, this is the eight-year-old Xiao Chen, who knew nothing, only found the image terrifying.

What was even more frightening was that he discovered that the eyes of the boy lying on the ground were still turning. At the moment he appeared, the boy’s gray eyes fell on himself. 

He was already like this, but he was still alive.

Xiao Chen was scared and crying as he said, “Are you okay? I’ll get someone to come and help you, don’t die.”

However, the boy stopped Xiao Chen in time. His expression did not change in the slightest, as if he did not feel the pain. He did not even frown, and his gray eyes did not waver. He softly said, “Are you an angel who came to take me away?”

How strange, so there are really angels in this world! 

But how can a person like him go to heaven?

Oh, so he’s not dead yet.

His heart has been ripped out, but he is still alive.



Xiao Chen did not say anything and squatted next to the boy, whimpering. 

He felt something that he could not explain. He thought he should run away in fear because it was in the middle of nowhere, and there was no telling what would come out at night to harm him. However, his heart ached at the sight of the boy’s gray eyes.

It was like…

The pain was not in the boy’s body but his own.

The gray-eyed boy tilted his head and could see Xiao Chen’s jawline clearly. The child’s face did not have much flesh and looked very much malnourished. 

He withdrew his gaze and continued to stare at the sky.

This night is really terribly dark. Not to mention the smallest stars, even the moon is not visible. There is nothing to be seen in the blackness.

The air is also very stuffy, making it a little hard to breathe.

And every part of his own body appeared like it was crushed by a car. His bones were broken, and it hurts, it hurts………

He could not move.

Is he going to die?

Then, his body must be delicious.

Maybe before he completely loses consciousness, he will see a wolf take one of his legs and then hide somewhere to enjoy his dinner. He may see a vulture pierce his large intestine, make him bleed, bite his flesh and bring it back to share with its children. 

Perhaps there will be a cunning fox who wants to drag his corpse, trying to make him a long-lasting reserve food. Or maybe even ants will line up to haul away his remains when there is little left of him.

What a terrible way to die.

However, it is certainly possible.

Even the birds and beasts are a bit reluctant to feed on his body, feeling his bad luck and thinking that the stench of his corpse is unpleasant. He thought that he was like everyone believed, that he was a disaster. Eventually, he was left in the wilderness, where he was exposed to the sun and wind and turned into a dried corpse. 

The boy’s thoughts seem to have drifted into outer space, thinking about something messy in his head.

Sure enough, not long after, he saw a pair of eyes that were still glowing in the night.

Those eyes were terribly bright and a little creepy.

It was a wolf. 

A wolf that was attracted by the smell of blood.

The child who was sitting next to him just now seemed to be terrified. His eyes that had been in tears immediately cried even more.

He watched as the child jerked to his feet, then the two looked at each other, and the latter ran away as fast as he could.

The boy looked at his departing back and couldn’t help but think. 

Well, that’s right, who would stay with him?

The wolf is so dangerous. If he doesn’t leave, won’t he be eaten by it?

With this in mind, the boy closed his eyes with hopelessness.

Thinking about his life, was he happy? 

Not really.

He hated it!

Why should he be called a disaster in his life, where so many people even want him to die? He is simply resentful!

Without any obstruction, the wolf’s glowing eyes became brighter as it jumped and rushed straight to the boy’s body and licked at his blood. 

It was ready to enjoy its feast.

“Go away! Go away! Don’t touch him!!!” A soft, tender voice suddenly sounded.

The boy who had already accepted his fate opened his eyes when he heard the voice and looked at the source of the sound immediately.

The child’s awkward body was still a bit unstable. The torch he got from somewhere was held in his hand as he rushed forward with vigor. He pointed the tip of the torch at the wolf’s position and forced the hungry wolf back one step at a time. 

It may be out of the animal’s nature to be afraid of fire that the wolf jumped off the boy’s body. With eyes that glowed in the night, he stared deadly at the child and made some distance.

But it didn’t give up. Instead, it chose to hover in place for a while and kept circling, as if it was waiting for the child to leave so it could rush up and proceed to enjoy its meal.

For it, this is a gourmet meal, so how could it give up so easily?

The child was trembling with his tears running down his face. The hand holding the torch was shaking, and it seemed as though he would run away in the next second because of fear. 

The boy stared at his face, looking at him slightly lost in thought, without speaking.

Time passed by, and the child still stood in front of him with a resolute face, like a knight holding the torch in his hand as though it was a sword, his weapon to protect his beloved one.

Even if he is afraid, he is still fearless.

The flaming light of the torch shone into the child’s eyes. 

The gray-eyed boy looked at these eyes that glowed brilliantly in the night and slightly had his mouth open wider with an indescribable sensation.

It was as if…

He seemed to see………

A sky full of stars. 

He was seeing salvation for the rest of his life.

He was seeing his whole world. 

–

Yang Ru and Li Gou Dan’s nerves were close to breaking down. 

These corridors were like a maze. There were no windows, and in the darkness, they couldn’t see any difference. It was like they were circling in the same place, and they couldn’t see the way out.

They couldn’t get out.

Li Gou Dan hit the wall with his hand in despair.

As Li Gou Dan smashed his hand against the wall, it was as though he had found something, and his eyes widened. He traced the bumpy spots on the surface of the wall and said in surprise, “Are there words on this?” 

Yang Ru was immediately attracted when she heard it and strode over.

She moved closer and began to identify the script carefully. She looked at the pattern on the wall, and after a pause, hesitantly said, “It’s English.”

When Li Gou Dan heard it, he was excited, “Then, you should translate it quickly.”

However, Yang Ru frowned, “The words on this seems to be somehow wrong………” 

Before Yang Ru could finish, Li Gou Dan waved his hand impatiently.

Su Jingxia stood indifferently at the side, but his eyes suddenly flickered. He looked a bit changed, and he said in a deep voice, “I’ll do it.”

Yang Ru glanced at him suspiciously a few times.

It was not that she was against him, but because she could speak English herself. English was like a native language to her, and she was very fluent. However, the English words on the wall were still wrong even when she read them in her usual way of speaking English. They could not be English at all, but she stepped back out of respect and gave way to Su Jingxia. 

Su Jingxia did not speak and had both hands in his pockets. His eyes were firmly fixed on the characters on the wall.

The time passed, and for a while, the three fell into an eerie silence as no one spoke.

Li Gou Dan stood on the side with an urgent expression and said anxiously, “Do you understand it or not? If you do, translate it quickly, and if you don’t understand it, just say so.”

Su Jingxia was not angered by his arrogant tone. On the contrary, he bowed his head and hooked his lips. His eyes were hidden under a shadow, which made it difficult to see his expression. It was incredibly mysterious in the dim environment. 

So that’s how it is.

Su Jingxia remembered Xu Caitong’s last words before he died, and it all became evident in his mind.

Li Gou Dan stepped forward, wanting to continue to say something.

However, before he could make a sound, he felt a sharp stabbing pain in his abdomen. He immediately stared at Su Jingxia with a disbelieving expression, as if he didn’t understand why he would suddenly do that. 

In an instant, an unpleasant smell of blood spread in the air.

Su Jingxia was still holding Xu Caitong’s dagger in his hand, but at this moment, the blade had already been completely submerged in Li Gou Dan’s abdomen.

Su Jingxia’s indifferent face still did not have the slightest fluctuation of emotion, but a closer look would reveal a sense of bloodthirsty horror. He pulled the dagger from Li Gou Dan’s abdomen, and blood spurted out along, splashing directly onto Su Jingxia’s clothes.

Su Jingxia gently scraped his teeth with the tip of his tongue, and the corners of his mouth rose. 

He already had several human lives on his hands, and even the bloodstains on his clothes were from a few people.

Heh, after all, he was already a lunatic.

There was no need to reason with a madman.

Li Gou Dan supported his abdomen with one hand, and his other hand was holding the wall. Before his slightly open mouth could close, he completely lost his support and fell to the side. 

And perhaps before he closes his eyes completely, he will not even know what the truth of his death is.

Yang Ru was utterly stunned by the scene in front of her.

Instantly, she felt terrible.

She took a step back without hesitation, and without saying anything, she ran like crazy. 

If she didn’t run, that maniac would definitely kill her!!!

Su Jingxia cocked his head and didn’t chase after her at first. Instead, he laughed out loud from where he was as if he was laughing at her discomfort.

The hand that was holding the dagger paused. He looked down and wiped the blade on his clothes. He looked like a psychopath as his eyes widened and were almost bulging out.

Since the mouse is disobedient, of course, it is necessary to kill it! 

Then, in that case, let’s play hide and seek.

Yang Ru’s breathing became increasingly rapid, and her heartbeat pounded incessantly as she ran with all her strength.

She doesn’t want to die!

Why would she want to die? 

It was at this moment that her brain lit up; it was like an afterthought reaction.

Wait, the English on the wall just now seems to be in the Caesar Cipher!!! 

By shifting all the letters back three places in the alphabet, new English words can be introduced. 

If that was the case, then the translation…

Yang Ru’s heart beat faster.

It translates to………

Kill everyone so you can leave this place. 

Heh, do you want to get out of here alive?

Burst out your killing nature and kill with madness.

This is my eternal curse upon you.

Heh. 

–

The sleeping Xiao Chen snapped his eyes open and grabbed his chest with his fingers tightly. He was covered in cold sweat, and there was a throbbing pain in his chest that was almost suffocating him.

He remembered, he remembered!

He actually came to this place!!! 

Xiao Chen sat up, and his eyes were slowly horrified.

Suddenly, a chest tightly embraced his entire shoulder from his back, and Xiao Chen trembled slightly at the moment he was touched.

It was Yu Mo.

Xiao Chen turned around with a pale face and met Yu Mo’s gray eyes. Yu Mo’s eyes were still so gentle, and his gaze was full of deep love and affection that could not be hidden. 

Xiao Chen opened his mouth and stared at these gray eyes.

He finally remembered.

He witnessed the man with gray eyes in front of him throw all the people in the village into this bizarre corridor.

Letting those people be devoured by pythons, pecked by crows, tormented by darkness and hunger, and finally, people eating people. 

He even set up a game rule of having only one survivor so that the group would kill each other inside.




“Did you have a nightmare?” Yu Mo’s hand gently stroked the bangs that blocked Xiao Chen’s eyes. The surrounding lights were not yet switched on. This posture had an indescribable ambiguity in the dim environment, making it look very intimate. 

The man has a quirk that was probably influenced by the memory of this world. He likes to stare into the eyes of Xiao Chen, and when the young man’s eyes reflect only his figure, it gives him a sense of satisfaction.

It felt as if the two were each other’s world.

Xiao Chen blinked and stared into Yu Mo’s eyes. The two were so close that it was as if they would kiss each other in the next second.

Xiao Chen’s feelings are very complicated at this moment. 

The two people stood still for a long time before Xiao Chen stiffly spoke, “Are you a human or not?”

If so, then why is he still alive after having his heart ripped out and even able to do things he’s only seen in TV shows. There is even another man who looks exactly like him.

If not, then what kind of identity is he living in now? Is it a ghost?

Xiao Chen felt his hands and feet became a bit frozen with this thought, and he shivered instinctively. The man’s eyes looked sunken, and the initially smiling corners of his mouth pursed into a straight line.

With a tug of his hand, Yu Mo put the quilt back over Xiao Chen’s body.

Xiao Chen blinked again with a dazed expression.

The man’s face was blank as he asked, “Is it important whether I’m human or not?”

Xiao Chen was suddenly silent and a little embarrassed. He subconsciously pouted, lowered his head, and glanced slightly upward to peek at the man’s expression. 

It seems that it is not that important.

He did not know if it was his illusion, but he felt that the feeling that Yu Mo had given him had changed, but this feeling was familiar to him.

It was like…

Xiao Chen searched for words in the bottom of his heart for quite a while. 

It was like a combination of the man he saw last time and Yu Mo.

Xiao Chen was also startled by his own thoughts.

The man looked at this expression and suddenly laughed out loud.

His memory had just recently recovered. He realized that Xiao Chen had been affected by the world more than him and that in comparison, his memory would only slowly awaken due to the passage of time. 

He found that Xiao Chen’s memories of each world would be completely cleared when he re-entered reincarnation, so much so that Xiao Chen had a significantly different personality in each world.

The rules of the world discovered their two sets of somewhat strange data early on, causing them to be rejected by the world consciousness in every world, which would try everything to create different problems for them and try to erase their existence.

But.

The man hooked his lips. 

He is a virus, and a virus is an existence outside the rules of the world, and his appearance is itself an exception.

He could easily break through the influence of the world’s consciousness on him. He was not bound by the original order, so he could destroy it if he wanted to and leave entirely if he wanted to detach himself from it. He could even plunder the world’s energy and store it in a medium not restricted by the world.

The man’s gaze moved to the pendant Xiao Chen was wearing, slightly narrowed his eyes, the pendant still looks as plain as ever. Still, only he knows how useful this necklace really is.

He himself can indeed just leave as he pleases. 

The look in the man’s eyes changed.

But Xiao Chen cannot!

Xiao Chen was created by these worlds. Xiao Chen will repeatedly surface in these worlds and suffer from various restrictions.

If not for his own initial mistake that resulted in not only failing to bring Xiao Chen out, but even caused him to nearly become part of these data, and making him lose his memory, the two of them would have been out of these worlds long ago. 

But fortunately.

He had marked Xiao Chen from the beginning.

The man thought of the tattoo on Xiao Chen’s back, and the corners of his mouth rose slightly.

They will definitely meet and love each other no matter what. 

As long as they experience more worlds, he can pillage more energy. When there is enough energy, he can take Xiao Chen completely out of these worlds and does not need to follow the plot of the world, nor does he have to let others control his fate.

Yu Mo touched Xiao Chen’s hair with his hand and smiled again as he looked at the aggrieved little face.

He reached out with both hands and grabbed the back of Xiao Chen’s head, placing his forehead closer to the child’s, allowing their eyes to stare at each other at a close distance.

Xiao Chen felt the temperature of the palm on his neck, and his brain all of a sudden short-circuited. When he realized the posture of the two people, his face instantly burst red. 

This posture is too ambiguous.

But the man was obviously not satisfied with this. He tilted his head and brought his face closer in a position where he could see the emotion on Xiao Chen’s eyes more clearly.

With the implication of coaxing, his gray eyes flickered slightly, and his voice was soft and gentle, saying, “Can I hold you now?”

“………” Xiao Chen opened his mouth and closed it again. The redness on his face has not yet dissipated. 

Wait, does this hug mean what he thinks it means?

Everything that followed happened as if it was so natural. All Xiao Chen remembered was that he had been crying, and his voice had become hoarse and eventually turned into a small whimper.

The man seemed to have been unfulfilled and had a lot of energy.

Xiao Chen felt like a small boat floating in the sea, being pushed over by the waves, and like a rose entangled by a poisonous snake, whose limbs were deadly wrapped around its branches, making it difficult for him to even breathe. 

He couldn’t even see the scene around him because there were no lights. He only saw a pair of wolf-like gray eyes staring at him without blinking.

“Baby, call me.”

“Call, call what?”

“Hmm.” 

“Yu, Yu Mo.”

“Call me husband.”

However, as if to guard his last shame, Xiao Chen did not make a sound and buried his head in the pillow. His face became even redder, and he was like a cooked lobster.

“Heh.” The man laughed out loud, his gray eyes flashed, and he hooked his lips in mischief, “Baby, you’re misbehaving again.” 

So, there should be a punishment, no?

–

Yang Ru’s hands were trembling like crazy. Even if her hands were clenched into a fist, they could not stop shaking.

Yang Ru found herself seemingly walking into a dead-end, spinning in circles in place for half a day. No matter which way she went, she would end up back where she was. 

When she realized this, she immediately tore off a piece of fabric from her clothes without hesitation. She put it on the ground to make a mark.

But when she saw the fabric lying on the ground for the third time, although she had prepared her heart, she still completely broke down.

Her fingers were sticking stiffly to the wall as she struggled to control her emotions and tried to comfort herself, but it was all in vain.

She felt as if these corridors had a consciousness of their own. 

From the beginning, where one goes and which path they choose is not up to them. These living corridors will take them where they want them to go.

She can’t get out at all!!!

No matter how strong Yang Ru’s psychological quality is, in the end, she is only a woman who has experienced too much in this short time. She doesn’t even know how long she has been in this space or how long it has been since she has eaten.

She could not see the sunrise, nor could she see the moon hanging in the sky. She was in a completely confined environment, surrounded by endless darkness, uncertainty, and fear, and she could not feel the passage of time. 

Yang Ru’s breathing was a little difficult, and she grabbed her collar with her trembling hands in a tight grip.

“Heh, finally found you.” A voice came out from the end of the long corridor.

When Yang Ru heard this voice, her body trembled even more. Her chest became more stuffy, and her breathing was even more uncomfortable.

This voice was like an evil creature from Hell, tormenting her nerves little by little. 

Su Jingxia was in no hurry to finish her off. It was like a cat teasing a mouse, tormenting her spirit and slowly exhausting her strength, then killing her in one go.

This kind of pain, to some extent, for Yang Ru, even far overshadowed her fear of death.

Yang Ru’s face was ashen as she sat on the ground, trembling, but she did not have any urge to continue to escape.

She was simply too tired. 

She was exhausted and had long since run out of energy.

[ Passerby876544: There seems to be no doubt about the result, Su Jingxia won.

Passerby876568:This time the live broadcast is more exciting than ever before, ah.

Passerby967563: Is the future sanctioner going to be changed into Su Jingxia leading the team? 

Passerby896756: Didn’t Xu Caitong also kill the last sanctioner, becoming the last one to live and win, and finally became the sanctioner?

Passerby667564: I have a question that I have wanted to know for a long time. Who is behind this live game of punishing criminals, and what is the purpose of it? Why do I feel that some of the camera angles are very strange, just like a face shot? Even variety shows do not shoot such effects, right?

Passerby643255: Haha, who knows? Isn’t watching this kind of live broadcast just for satisfying your own pleasure?

Passerby642247: Hey, I have a bold guess. Do you believe that there are gods in this world? Because the life of the gods is too boring, they like to watch people torment each other, so they made such a murderous live broadcast game, taking the bloodshed as their entertainment. ] 

Yang Ru’s body on the ground slowly grew cold and stiffened up a bit.

And Su Jingxia’s expression remained undisturbed.

The result was already obvious.

He won. 

He survived.

Su Jingxia dropped the dagger on the ground. His hand was full of blood, which flowed down the lines of his palm and fell on the floor.

Time passed in silence. Su Jingxia stood still and did not move.

He tilted his head slightly and looked up. The top was still an endless darkness, and he could not see the end at all. There was no way to know what sort of birds or beasts were hidden up there. 

He withdrew his gaze, bypassed Yang Ru’s corpse, and continued to walk forward.

As long as he keeps walking, he will be able to leave this damn place, right?

Heh.

Su Jingxia’s figure was completely submerged in the darkness. He slowly moved forward in the quiet and frightening environment, and his footsteps could even be heard echoing, along with his own thumping heartbeat. 

The only sound left in the world comes from him alone.

What lies ahead…

Is it an exit?

Not necessarily. 

Perhaps it’s an endless cycle.




The exhausted Xiao Chen was lying on top of Yu Mo. His hair was a mess, and the sweat stains on his body were sticky. He was too tired to open his eyes. 

The man covered the quilt on Xiao Chen’s body. His gray eyes were staring at the other’s sleeping face, and his fingers were constantly stroking the Xiao Chen’s hair on both sides. It was as if looking at a great treasure that was fragile and needed to be cared for and collected.

Xiao Chen was still half awake. Probably because of his clean nature, he subconsciously pushed a man’s chest while softly muttering, “I want to take a bath.”

The man did not speak. Instead, he smiled and kissed Xiao Chen’s right little earlobe.

The other’s expression slightly stifled, and the hand placed on the man’s chest paused. He opened his eyes in confusion and said, “I heard your heartbeat.” 

Wasn’t the man’s heart ripped out?

Xiao Chen’s confused half-open eyes saw the man’s mouth moved. However, it may be because he was too sleepy that he did not hear it clearly. He rubbed against the man’s chest, and before he could get a specific answer, he fell asleep completely.

Yu Mo looked at this dazed face. The corners of his mouth hooked up as he lowered his head and gently placed a kiss on the young man’s forehead.

Sleep, my little rose.

Xiao Chen’s hand is still placed on the location of the man’s heart. The man’s heart is thumping, and his chest is slowly rising and falling along with it.

The man gently picked him up, intending to carry him to the bathroom.

In an instant, all the lights in the entire room lit up, and the yellow halo-colored light shone on the young boy.

While the color of the tattoo on his back seemed to have been cleaned, the original dark color became enchanting and vivid, especially the color of the rose petals that became redder than before. 

Unfortunately, Xiao Chen did not hear any of those words.

And that statement was:

My heart has always been hidden in you, and as soon as you came back, it returned to me.

In this world, there is just one him, and he has always been one of a kind. 

“Haven’t you thought that between us, besides the death of one side and the other alive, there can still be other options”.

“What choice?”

“Let us be one person.”

“Xiao Chen, wake up. Why are you sleeping in the library?” The boy held his glasses with one hand and pushed Xiao Chen, who was lying on the table, with the other hand. Out of kindness, he woke up Xiao Chen, who had fallen asleep for some unknown reason. 

Xiao Chen snapped his eyes open and looked up at the boy with glasses who called him. His mouth was open but didn’t make a sound as he sat up with a startled face. He looked around a few times, and his eyes were filled with confusion and doubts.

“You………” Xiao Chen swallowed and stood up to say something, but the book at the table in front of him fell on the floor with a “PONG” sound because of his sudden movements. The loud sound startled Xiao Chen and managed to make the surrounding students, who were concentrating on their studies, look towards the source of the sound.

The boy wearing glasses saw this and nodded towards Xiao Chen with an apologetic face. Then, he fled the scene quickly, leaving a dumbfounded Xiao Chen, who continued to be confused about the situation.

Xiao Chen sat back in his original position, picked up the book at his feet, and put it on the table. The surrounding eyes also retracted one after another. 

Was everything he experienced a dream?

Xiao Chen was in a bit of a trance, and his mind was still a bit muddled.

No! There is no way!

Xiao Chen’s eyes instantly become firm, and a stream of light flashed in his eyes. 

How could it be that he was dreaming!

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen seemed to have suddenly remembered something and looked down at his neck with wide eyes.

The scythe-shaped pendant was still hanging intact on his neck as if it has always been worn and never taken off.

When Xiao Chen saw the necklace, his heart calmed down. He clutched the necklace tightly and held it in the palm of his hand, feeling an indescribable heartache. He even wanted to cry a bit as tears once again swirled in his eyes. 

It is uncertain how long it took for Xiao Chen, who sat silently in place for some time, to be shaken up. His aggrieved face unfolded, and the tears that were in his eyes flowed down.

“What are you crying for? Well, be good and wait for me to come to you, my little rose.”

A voice appeared out of nowhere in Xiao Chen’s ears. This magnetic and somewhat hoarse voice sounded like it was close to his ears. He could even hear the man’s breathing, and the exhaled breath blew into his ears, making his ears tickle a little.

There is no mistaking it. It is Yu Mo’s voice. 

Xiao Chen’s face turned slightly red, and he sniffed. While no one around saw him crying, he hurriedly wiped his face and said in a small voice, “Then you have to be quick oh, or I won’t wait for you, hmph.”

The last word, ‘hmph,’ did not sound like a threat but instead like he was pouting.

Just like a little kitten with a big temper, scratching the shovel officer with its claws as a threat to get their attention. As soon as the shovel officer comes up to kiss and hug, they immediately shrink meekly in the arms of the shovel officer.

Xiao Chen did not hear the man’s reply but only heard the man laugh lightly. His laughter was with a hint of helplessness and indulgence. 

After a long time, the man said, “Then during this time, you must take good care of yourself.” The man paused and then said with a flirting tone, “Otherwise, I will punish you well by then.”

Xiao Chen subconsciously shivered when he heard the word punishment. His face immediately flushed red like he had a fever, and some unholy images flashed through his mind.

He wanted to scream out loud, but he could only hold it in. Eventually, he had to lie on the table and grit his teeth.

Ah ah ah ah, how can you say such excessive words. 

Shameless, f*cking shameless.

Xiao Chen sat at the back of the classroom by the window, and he placed his bag on the table.

He gently took all the desserts out of the bag and stuffed them inside the table, filling almost a drawer full of them.

The class will start later, but he hasn’t eaten breakfast yet. 

Xiao Chen put his books on the table and stuffed one hand inside the table, secretly taking out a cupcake and stuffing it into his mouth in one big bite. Before he could chew twice, he heard the door of the classroom pushed open suddenly, followed by a sound of footsteps.

The teacher is here.

Xiao Chen immediately lowered his head and chewed frantically for fear of being seen by the teacher. Perhaps he ate too fast, but the food actually got stuck in his throat, making him cough loudly.

Holding it in made his face even redder. 

A pair of long legs stood directly in front of him, putting down a bottle of water on his desk and then walking back to the lecture table.

Xiao Chen’s chewing mouth instantly stopped. Lifting his head, he stared blankly at the man’s series of actions, and his eyes nearly spelled confusion in capital letters.

The man looked at him with a smile on his face from the podium. Xiao Chen’s cheeks were bulging like a small hamster that had stolen food.

Xiao Chen looked at this all-too-familiar face and had not yet recovered. But then, it might be because it was uncomfortable to have food stuffed in his mouth that he finally returned to his senses. He picked up the mineral water on the table and quietly opened it. He poured water into his mouth before finally feeling a little better. 

Xiao Chen lowered his head as his face was still red and tried hard to reduce his presence.

He looked at the books on the table and then at the man on the podium, followed by a glance around the classroom, where many girls put their heads close together and whispered about something with a blossoming face.

Xiao Chen had the illusion that he was dreaming.

Wait, wasn’t the teacher of this class a bald Mediterranean? 

Xiao Chen poked the boy sitting in front of him and put his head closer to the boy’s side, “Where is the previous teacher for this class?”

The boy turned around with a strange look on his face and asked in return, “What last teacher? Hasn’t it always been Mr. Yu?”

Xiao Chen was even more stunned when he heard that.

The man who has been paying attention to Xiao Chen’s every move saw two heads that were only a few centimeters apart and narrowed his eyes a little dangerously. 

Heh.

“The second from the last one in this row stand up and answer this question,” The man uttered with a stern look on his face.

The boy sitting in front of Xiao Chen was startled, opened his mouth wide, and stood up with a dumbfounded face.

Xiao Chen was instantly silenced when he saw this and sat motionless in his position with an honest face. 

The aroma from the dessert inside the table was too fragrant. Not even halfway through the class, Xiao Chen’s sinful little hand reached into the drawer again and quietly took out the cupcake. He continued to stuff it into his mouth, eating one bite at a time with great satisfaction.

The man’s expressionless face on the podium nearly broke because of the child’s small expression of stealing food.

So the lesson passed pleasantly with the man lecturing seriously and Xiao Chen eating cupcakes.

Finally, the class ended. The man hinted with his eyes at Xiao Chen, who had been staring at himself with bright eyes. Then, he walked out of the classroom, and Xiao Chen immediately trailed after him. 

The man cornered Xiao Chen on the stairway. He looked at the other’s pouty lips and narrowed his eyes, “You’re disobedient again. You didn’t even listen in my class.”

Xiao Chen thought he was talking about his eating in class. He lowered his head and defended in a small voice, “I only ate four cupcakes, not too much.”

The man was amused by his little expression but still looked at Xiao Chen with a serious face, making Xiao Chen, who originally had many doubts in his heart and wanted to ask him, instantly shut up.

The man’s head moved up to Xiao Chen’s ear with an ascetic expression, “Baby, you’re really misbehaving.” 

Xiao Chen sniffed and lowered his head somewhat sheepishly, not daring to make a sound.

The man’s lips pressed against Xiao Chen’s neck.

Xiao Chen jolted and subconsciously dodged.

The man stretched out his tongue and rubbed his teeth on Xiao Chen’s neck again. 

The man looked like he had thought of something funny and curled his lips, “So, I’m going to punish you.”

Xiao Chen was stunned.

Immediately afterward, he heard the man give a flirtatious laugh and continued, “What do you think about a teacher and student play, hmm, student Xiao Chen?”

Xiao Chen’s eyes widened, and before he could resist, the man’s mouth sealed his lips. 

As for what unholy things will happen tonight, it can only depend on Xiao Chen’s fate.




Arc 5 Ghost Eyes


“Senior Xiao Chen.” 

Xiao Chen, who was staring out of the window, looked at the source of the voice calling him.

The one who spoke was a girl with a pretty face and a good temperament. Her face had a thin layer of red that seemed to rise because of shyness. She was wearing a skirt that didn’t go past her knees, and she had a good figure. She was the kind of girl who looked very popular, and it was not too much to say that she was a goddess.

Xiao Chen was expressionless. His pair of phoenix eyes were charming, yet there was no emotion in them.

“That, are you free today? Can we have lunch together later?” The girl asked cautiously as if she was worried about being rejected. Her movements were also somewhat restrained and rushed, and her two hanging hands were slightly unsettled. 

Xiao Chen was silent for three seconds and did not make a sound, as if he was thinking of a suitable reason for refusing someone.

The girl saw through his mind, and her expression was a bit embarrassed. She hurriedly said, “If you’re not available, just forget it, we can meet again later, okay?”

The girl said very thoughtfully and nicely at the same time. Not only did she give Xiao Chen an excuse to refuse this time, but she also did not make it too awkward for the two of them. Then, she proposed a new invitation, which made it difficult to refuse her again.

Xiao Chen raised his eyes and calmly met the girl’s gaze, who looked a little shifty from such a look.

Xiao Chen directly stretched out the left hand that had been placed on the table, waved it in front of the girl’s eyes, and spoke, “Sorry, I’m married.”

The girl’s face instantly became white, like she heard something unbelievable. She froze in place, her mouth dropped open, and her eyes watered. She turned around and ran away while covering her eyes.

Xiao Chen’s expression did not waver throughout, and he did not feel the slightest bit of guilt when the girl ran away in tears. He sat there, turned his head back, and continued to look out the window.

The next second, someone sat in front of his desk. The person was holding a book, a pen, and a glass of lemonade with ice. 

Wang Qingchuan laughed and teased, “How come another schoolgirl is crying over your wedding news ah.”

The boy’s tone is still mostly teasing with a bit of gloating.

To be honest, the first time he heard Xiao Chen say he was married, he also silently went back to digest the news for a whole night before accepting it. However, after so long, he has never even seen the marriage partner or seen Xiao Chen make a suspiciously ambiguous phone call.

He could not help but think several times that Xiao Chen had made up the lie to refuse a confession. Still, Xiao Chen’s poker face was not like a person who would joke with such words. 

Xiao Chen picked up the book on the table, looked at the boy, stood up, and indifferently said, “You talk too much.”

Then, he left without hesitation. His face still without any fluctuation as he left the boy sitting in the same place. 

“You smell so good.” The man with a wicked face and big nostrils was drooling. His eyes were bloodshot, and he was holding a crushed and bloody arm in his one intact hand. His feet were not on the ground but floating in the air, and it was horrifying.

Especially from Xiao Chen’s perspective, he was even able to see other students who did not know the truth walked directly through the man’s body, going back and forth. 

And the man kept making circles around Xiao Chen, coming up from time to time to smell Xiao Chen’s body, mouth drooling as if looking at a delicious meat.

Xiao Chen’s eyebrows tightly wrinkled together, and his breath was even a little restrained. Cold sweat was on his temples, but his feet are still walking at a normal speed. He did not bother to look at the man’s face as if there is no difference with everyone around.

Of course, in addition to this man, he could see all kinds of ghosts at a glance in the library. Some were homeless beggars, and some were students who committed suicide in school. There were all kinds of weird and strange ones.

In the eyes of other students, Xiao Chen has facial paralysis. Usually, no matter how to tease him, he will not have any change of expression. 

But that’s because they don’t know that Xiao Chen can see ghosts since childhood. He forced himself into a facial paralysis as a way to cover up his fear when he sees something inhuman.

The man wanted to come closer to Xiao Chen, but he was burned by something fierce when his feet were only three meters away from Xiao Chen. The expression on his face instantly became hideous and agonized. His face, which was already not very pleasant, became very distorted.

The man threw his head back and let out a sharp moan/groan. Even the arm he was holding was thrown to the ground by himself as he crouched straight down with his whole body trembling in place.

Xiao Chen did not even turn his head back but could hear that mournful scream getting louder and louder. 

He walked straight out the door of the library and seemed to have long been accustomed to it.

The weather today is quite strange. It was very foggy when he got up in the morning, and there was no trace of the sun coming out during the day. It was very gloomy, along with the lack of sunshine.

Xiao Chen’s footsteps stopped at the side of the road because of the traffic light, and his gaze unconsciously landed at the little girl squatting on the crosswalk.

The little girl looked to be only 13 or 14 years old, and her features were already difficult to discern. She was bloodied and was wearing a white dress. 

That’s………

Xiao Chen’s brow furrowed, and his expression was somewhat serious.

The white dress that she was wearing. There was blood all over the private part of her body. What’s even stranger is that there was only blood in that area, while the rest of her body was clean and dry. 

After death, people will be in their last form of flesh/body before they die and continue to live in the world as ghosts. Most ghosts will even be trapped in the last place before they die and cannot leave because of their obsession. 

There was blood in that kind of place, and the connection between it and the death of the little girl would invariably make people think of something terrible.

The little girl kept her head down. She squatted on the crosswalk with cars passing through her body. No one could see her as she remained in place like a wooden stake.

Xiao Chen could not help but speculate in his mind about the cause of this little girl’s death.

But the next scene that happened made a crack appear on his always expressionless face. 

When a car is only about ten meters away from the little girl and is about to hit her, a figure jumped out from the opposite side of the road, grabbed the little girl’s hand, and then avoided the car.

It happened so fast that it instantly attracted everyone around to stop.

It is also fortunate that the car owner reacted quickly to stop the car and avoided having a car accident.

The car owner broke out in a cold sweat and furiously rolled open the window, cursing, “You are sick, suddenly rushing out like that.” 

The scolded boy paused, gasping for breath.

He was stunned because of the car owner’s remarks. He opened his mouth and intended to argue that he almost hit a girl, but when he turned around to look at the girl he had just saved, he found that the person who should have been standing next to him had disappeared at some point.

And everyone around him was looking at him with an expression like they had seen a ghost, like he had done something hurtful.

Because the boy was not hurt, plus the car behind him had been urging him, the car that almost hit the boy soon drove again. 

The boy stood in place with a dumbfounded look on his face. He raised both hands, stared at his palms, looked back at the ground, and gulped.

Obviously, the touch just now was real!

How could this happen?

He can’t be seeing ghosts, right? 

At that very moment, the green light on the pedestrian walkway came on, and Xiao Chen followed the flow of people forward.

Xiao Chen glanced at the boy who was already completely dumb in his spot and then at the little girl who was standing motionless and staring at the boy’s face in a daze.

At this moment, Xiao Chen noticed that the little girl’s face began to repair at a speed visible to the naked eye. The features, which were initially a puddle of mush, slowly filled up. The skin turned from red to white, transforming into a regular human face.

The boy let out a deep breath and slapped his head with his hand. He picked up his school bag, which he had just thrown on the ground in a hurry, patted the dust on it, and fled the scene in disarray. 

The boy did not know that the little girl followed him and left the original place where she was trapped.

However, the boy did not look at the little girl from the beginning to the end. To be precise, he could no longer see her.

Xiao Chen’s house was bought near the school, so he doesn’t stay in a dormitory.

At this time, he was standing at the door of his house, hesitating to take out the key from his pocket. Just at that moment, the door was opened very naturally. 

The strange thing is that no one is standing at the door, and there was only the transparent air. However, Xiao Chen is not surprised by this. He changed into his slippers by the door and walked straight in.

There was already food prepared on the table, and it looked smoky even from a distance, so it was clear at a glance that it hadn’t been long since it was ready.

Xiao Chen just sat down on the chair when his shoulders were held from behind. A head was placed next to his neck, inhaling his scent, and his long hair was tangled in Xiao Chen’s clothes. Xiao Chen moved uncomfortably and adjusted his posture so that the man behind him could hold him with more comfort.

“Baby, you’re back.” Jing Hezhi rubbed his head against Xiao Chen’s neck. Then, he couldn’t resist extending his teeth to take a bite at Xiao Chen’s collarbone. It didn’t take long for it to turn red and become a hickey. 

The man is not wearing modern clothes. On the contrary, the man’s clothes were very complicated. There was a belt around his waist, and his long hair was not tied up with anything and was hanging down naturally on the sides. His large red outer garment looked loose and saggy, like the kind of wretched beauty portrayed in a story.

Xiao Chen’s face was a little red from the man’s kiss.

Only in the place where there is this man that there are no unjust ghosts around, so Xiao Chen does not need to continue to have a cold face and hide his fear.

He turned around graciously in the man’s arms to face him, stopping at a distance of only a few centimeters. 

Xiao Chen unashamedly reached out both hands and directly hooked the man’s neck so that the man had to lower his head. Then, he boldly moved closer and bit hard on the man’s chin.

Jing Hezhi smiled, and the corners of his mouth rose.

This smile completely stunned Xiao Chen and made the blush on Xiao Chen’s face even redder.

Xiao Chen moved his hands to the man’s waist and pushed them through the man’s loose clothing to wrap his arms around the other man’s waist. 

The hands were still moving around dishonestly.

However, the man directly scooped up Xiao Chen from his chair with one hand. His eyes narrowed dangerously, “It seems that you don’t plan to eat first.”

Xiao Chen dropped a kiss on the man’s lips without the slightest bit of coyness, “I want to eat you.”




As soon as Xiao Chen arrived at the school entrance, he couldn’t help but knit his brows. His eyes glanced around a few times, observing the surrounding environment. 

Strange, there are more ghosts in the school today.

The most obvious point is that you can feel a puff of darkness once you enter the school gate. Ordinary people may only feel the temperature on campus is very low, but Xiao Chen was able to see through the ghosts walking around the campus like zombies.

In fact, in general, as long as it is a school, the Yin energy will be significantly heavier than in other places. This is because schools are generally built on sites such as crematoriums and areas where corpses have been buried. After all, they are cheaper. This is also the reason why Xiao Chen did not want to stay in a dormitory.

But today’s ghosts are more than usual and a bit more abnormal. 

The second Xiao Chen’s feet just stepped into the campus, he could feel the ghosts start to get a little restless. Their eyes were all locked onto his body for a while and then began to wander around him, their noses constantly sniffing his scent.

One by one, they uncontrollably rushed up to him, but all would be bounced out by what appeared to be a barrier when they were only three meters away. Some were burned, some were electrocuted, and some even had their souls corrupted.

One after another, no ghosts dared to get too close to Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen is not surprised.

His Yin energy is very heavy and is a good tonic for ghosts. However, ordinary ghosts can’t harm people. Only cultivated and even resentful ghosts can pose harm to people, but there are usually very few of these ghosts.

Xiao Chen’s expression was a little cold when he thought about it.

He grew up living in fear of being tormented by ghosts. Those who found out he had ghost eyes would use it to scare and intimidate him. His special ability caused all the people around him to think he was mentally ill, and even his biological parents abandoned him.

Because he was good-looking, all those who wanted to adopt could see him at first glance, but the result was invariably the same. He was returned to the orphanage, again and again, experiencing countless hopes, all of which were reduced to deeper despair. 

He called for help at first. He was afraid, but later, he became indifferent, numb, and even closed himself completely.

Until that day………

Until he met that man.

The corners of Xiao Chen’s mouth twitched slightly when he thought of this. 

He met his light.

Then the light brightened his dim eyes.

“You look so delicious.” The woman with a big belly was drooling, and her face was fierce as she circled around Xiao Chen, whose hands were clenched in fists. His face was indifferent as he continued to walk forward as if he didn’t know that a ghost had followed him the whole way.

The woman, however, blocked Xiao Chen’s path and floated right in front of him. 

Xiao Chen’s footsteps paused, barely pretending not to be aware of the woman’s body, before moving forward.

The woman looked like she had discovered something and gave a surprised look.

Xiao Chen’s pace quickened. the woman rushed close to Xiao Chen’s ear with a playful smile, “Little friend, you can see me, can’t you?”

Xiao Chen did not say anything and continued to walk forward. 

The woman did not let him go, but instead, her body pressed closer to Xiao Chen, “In this orphanage, you are the best-looking. Sister really wants to eat you.”

The woman’s saliva flowed out. The face that was a few points whiter than the wall was cut by a knife and had countless blood marks. Her skin was open, her face was hideous, and she was very fat and looked flabby.

She spoke in a whispery voice. Her body kept leaning closer to Xiao Chen, and she even called herself sister.

Xiao Chen’s cold sweat emerged as he braced himself not to show a disgusted look. 

But Xiao Chen’s micro-expressions still betrayed him. The woman’s already horrified face became even more pronounced with bloodstains, and her eyes bulged outward with an enraged look.

“Even you look down on me.” The woman gritted her teeth, and her voice was so loud that it could almost pierce one’s eardrums. She stretched out her hand, trying to grab Xiao Chen.

The woman’s fingernails were long. Her nail caps were black, and her nail crevices were filthy with dirt.

Xiao Chen initially thought the woman would not touch him, but the next second, the woman grabbed Xiao Chen’s wrist with a violent force, making Xiao Chen fall to the ground. 

Xiao Chen can even hear the sound of his bones breaking, and his expression was one of disbelief.

The woman was also stunned. It seems that she did not expect to be able to grab the child.

In the next second, the woman’s expression can be described as insane. Her gaze fell dead on Xiao Chen’s body, and she pulled open her big mouth, which looked gut-wrenching. She looked at Xiao Chen as if she was looking at a delicious delicacy.

Xiao Chen lying on the ground in fear, helplessly opened his mouth. 

Suddenly, his eyes flickered slightly as if he thought of something. He drew two red candles from his pocket with his last strength, breaking it as he mumbled something. His hands trembled uncontrollably because of fear, as if he was a dying criminal making his final struggle.

The woman looked at the boy in front of her with a mocking face as he did a series of useless things. She tilted her head and let out a laugh that sounded like it was going to rip through her throat.

Then, with one hand, she grabbed Xiao Chen’s neck and lifted him from the ground.

The two red candles in Xiao Chen’s hand also fell to the ground. 

Xiao Chen’s face was getting red as his throat was strangled, and his legs were also completely off the ground.

“pong,” there was a loud bang.

The woman’s hand that was locked around Xiao Chen’s neck lurched. The bloody mouth that had been opened to the maximum was frozen in the air. Even the scarlet tongue had forgotten to move. The woman’s hands softened and ultimately released Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen lost his strength and nearly fainted as he fell backward, but a pair of hands that were incomparably faster wrapped around his waist from behind him and then held him in his arms. 

The woman looked like she was being cut by a thousand knives. The blood marks on her entire face were infinitely enlarged, and her whole ghostly body was fading away. The next second, she completely turned into a puddle of blood in place with only the shrill hissing sound piercing the sky, which was creepy.

Xiao Chen did not see the frightening scene because his eyes were attracted by the man holding himself. He was in awe and even forgot the pain of his broken bones.

The man was dressed in red with his loose black hair hanging down on both sides, slightly blown up by the wind, and his eyes were very light gray.

The man’s hands held Xiao Chen in his arms. He lowered his eyes and looked at the young child in his embrace. 

There is no telling what kind of magic was used as the man’s fingers moved slightly, causing the red candle that was originally thrown on the ground to fly up by itself and then fell directly into the man’s hand.

Jing Hezhi stared at the child’s pair of phoenix eyes that have not yet developed and froze. It was like there was some kind of magic in these eyes that pacified the mountains and rivers. A single glance made him fall instantly.

The man’s five fingers gently stroked the wounds on the child’s back, silently healing them. His previously cold eyes violently flared the moment when they touched.

The child’s bones are broken! 

The man’s face sank, and he forced himself to hold back his raging anger. The air pressure dropped even lower.

His hands moved more carefully, afraid of hurting the porcelain doll in his arms.

Xiao Chen, however, took the initiative to break the peaceful tranquility between the two, asking out, “Are you a god?”

Otherwise, how can he be so good-looking? 

The man smiled at the words, and the gloomy expression cracked as the corner of his mouth lifted. The red candles were also grasped in the man’s hand.

Xiao Chen only saw the beauty in front of him move his lips.

He said, “No, I’m your future husband.”

Xiao Chen returned from his memories, and the corners of his mouth hooked upwards slightly at some point. 

“Look, someone on the rooftop is going to jump eh.”

“Damn, it’s true. Quickly take a picture with your phone.”

“Shit, it’s sick, jumping off a building in school.”

………… 

Xiao Chen smiled and lifted his head slightly.

As expected, a figure was sitting on the edge of the rooftop, staring blankly at the scenery downstairs.

Many students have gathered under the building. Some took out their phones to take videos, photos, and others directly launched a live broadcast. Only a few rushed into the building with the intention of calling teachers to deal with the situation, and a few students have already started to call the police.

“Oh my gosh, that man seems to be my professor!” A student recognized the man and covered his mouth with a horrified expression. 

The next second, the crowd let out a shattering chatter as more and more people recognized who he was.

“What’s going on, what’s going on? Professor Li is crazy. Why does he suddenly want to jump off the building?”

But at this time, no one could give the crowd an answer.

Xiao Chen’s mouth twitched. 

There was more than one person there.

The man’s eyes were lifeless, and his legs were hanging in the air. His back was slumped, and his neck fell to one side, barely maintaining his body’s balance in a distorted position.

A little girl in a white dress was standing behind him. One of her hands was clutching the man’s collar as she looked down at the crowd of people watching from below. Her expression was numb throughout.

It took only one glance for Xiao Chen to recognize the girl. 

It was the little girl from yesterday.

The strange thing is that yesterday, her face clearly recovered to normal, but today, the blood marks on her face were even more than before. And the Yin energy emanating from her body was denser than before. It was so dense that it had utterly affected the weather and made the surrounding lonely souls and spirits continuously attracted and gradually come.

Just how much resentment does it take to reach this level?

Xiao Chen frowned. 

Every injustice has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor. This saying is true.

Generally, ghosts will lose their memories after death, and even those with deep resentment are no exception. However, these resentful ghosts will give themselves an extremely strong psychological implication before they die. As long as they can meet their enemies again after they die, they will be desperate for revenge.

More and more people gathered downstairs, and a security guard rushed out to maintain order.

The man whose eyes were cloudy and godless finally sobered up. He was startled and then opened his mouth wide. It was like the frightening feeling of a sleepwalker who walks to the edge of a rooftop while dreaming and then suddenly wakes up with a jolt. 

The man’s arms and legs were shaking as if he didn’t know why he was here.

He subconsciously wanted to get down from above.

It was at this moment that he suddenly realized that something was grabbing his collar.

He looked back, and a bloody face stared at him coldly. He instantly shuddered, his feet sagged, and he almost fell, but the girl kept hold of his collar, so he was able to retain his balance. 

The man looked at the dense crowd downstairs and wanted to open his mouth to call for help, but he suddenly found himself unable to open his mouth, and he could only make an uh-uh sound.

The students downstairs noticed the man moving and mistakenly thought he was going to jump. For a moment, all of them raised their phones in unison as if to record the moment.

The girl watched the scene downstairs and let out an unpleasant and frightening laugh.

She grabbed the man’s head, forcing the other side to look at her. Her voice was cold and piercing, with an unconcealed anger, “Are you familiar with this scene in front of you?” 

The man was trembling like a sieve as he looked at the skin-open face. He moved to shrink his head with some resistance and let out the sound of whimpering.

The girl looked downstairs as if everything had gone back to the past.

“Teacher, don’t you remember me? I’m Lulu ah.”

The man’s eyes widened when he heard this. 

I am Lulu ah, the little girl you r*ped.

Have you forgotten?



The man’s expression was worse than that of eating sh*t. His face was also horribly white, and cold sweat was coming out on his forehead. His eyes were bulging as if they would jump out, and his lips were quivering with fear. 

Lulu laughed, and the corners of her mouth pulled wide open. She looked like a maniac. She moved her head, and her neck made a clicking sound. She grabbed the man’s chin and forced him to look at her. A bloody and distorted face was exposed in the daylight, making the man let out a whimper.

Lulu lowered her head, and her gaze locked on the crowd of people watching downstairs. There were already many students below. Even though security guards were pulling their voices to maintain order, many students still pushed their way to the center, wanting to have a better look. In addition to the shock in their expressions, they couldn’t hide the indifference they had when seeing someone attempting suicide and the hidden satisfaction they felt as they witnessed someone else’s misfortune.

See, there are people in this world who are worse than I am. Compared to that, I am really happy.

Looking at all the ugly faces, more and more blood streamed from Lulu’s face, and her skin rotted even more horribly. She moved her mouth to say, “Teacher, look, they all want you to die.” 

Then, she held down the man’s head, forcing him to look below. Once again, the man nearly fell because of the imbalance of his body, and unsurprisingly, the commotion downstairs intensified. The number of people holding up their phones as they watched the scene also increased.

Perhaps, if not for the presence of the security guards, the students probably would have been impatient and shouted directly, Are you jumping or not? I’m in a hurry!

Lulu seemed to recall something, and the strength in her hands became stronger all of a sudden.

“Teacher, I was only fourteen when I died! I was supposed to live a good life! If I were still alive, I would have already graduated from college by now.” Lulu’s voice began to crack as she continued.

Then it was followed by a loud, unpleasant laugh as she went on to say, “Why? Why!” Lulu’s voice was getting louder and louder, like the roar of a raging lion.

“I am obviously the victim, but why is everyone accusing me of being in the wrong” Lulu laughed louder; her expression was crazed, “Blaming me for revealing clothes, calling me shameless, and laughing at me because I deserved it. They even criticized my past and constantly mocked me, just to prove that I was at fault.” Her eyes were a bit dull, and her voice weakened, “just to prove that I deserved everything that I suffered!”

Her bloody black nails pinched into the man’s skin, staining it with blood, “Teacher, remember that day when I was standing in a place like this too, and you were standing right below watching me. Then the whole world laughed at me, just like they are now, and everyone couldn’t wait for me to die!!!! Hahahaha!!!”

“But what about you, the perpetrator!” Lulu’s voice faltered, “Only dismissed under school disciplinary action! Changed your name! Changed your learning environment and actually became a college professor! Being respected and praised by people!” 

“No one can remember the dirty things you’ve done anymore!”

“And no one will remember that there existed a girl in this world called Chen Lulu!!! She once lived too!!!”

She once was trying so hard to live in this world!

“Teacher Li, calm down!!!” The door of the rooftop was violently rammed open with force, followed by the rushing in of a hoard of people. 

It was the school’s teachers, security guards, and a few students who had informed them of the situation.

The man’s eyes instantly lit up as if he had seen the dawn of hope, and his expression was one of unconcealed surprise.

He moved his mouth, but the sound that came out was still a muffled whimper.

Help me!!! 

Lulu turned back and looked at the group that had anxious faces.

She laughed so hard that more blood flowed out of her face.

“Mr. Li, if you have any dissatisfaction with the school, we can solve it properly in private. If you feel that your teaching tasks are heavy, we can also reduce the weight! Life only comes once! There is nothing that can’t be discussed properly.” The one who spoke out was a female teacher who was the school’s psychologist.

She saw that the man did not respond or do anything to resist her. She took a few more steps forward, seemingly intending to continue to persuade the man patiently. 

But how would she know what this man who calls himself Mr. Li has recklessly disregarded human decency and is actually a monster in disguise?

Lulu looked at this ridiculous scene in front of her.

Why is it that when she died, no one came out to give her a hand?

She laughed again with a touch of madness. 

As Nietzsche said, one does not kill by anger but by laughter.

The man’s eyes could not hide his urge to live.

Without hesitation, Lulu released her grip on the man. 

It’s time for you to die too.

The man’s eyes widened, his body uncontrollably tilted down, and his terrified eyes fixed on Lulu before falling completely. However, he was unable to struggle or even let out the slightest scream.

The people above were horrified, especially the female teacher who could hardly conceal the disbelief in her eyes.

In the next second, frantic, chaotic, and panicked shouts came from downstairs, followed by a loud “pong” sound. 

Blood flowed.

Dead on the spot.

It is only logical that a ghost with great revenge should have less resentment after getting revenge.

Xiao Chen silently observed the resentment on the girl’s head. 

Her resentment has not decreased but instead has an increasing trend.

Lulu looked at the tragic body downstairs, sneered, and let the blood on her face flow down crazily. It then stained her white dress, starting from the collar and to the rest of the dress. In a short while, it had been completely dyed into red with blood. Paired with that bloody face, it was gruesome and horrifying.

She did not look happy to have her great revenge. On the contrary, her anger burned even more vigorously.

Not enough! Far from enough! 

Who else? Who else is there?

Lulu clenched her fist. Why is her resentment not gone? Who else is not dead?

Her eyes focused on those below. Suddenly, as though she had spotted something in the crowd, the corners of her mouth curled upward again, like a clown performing a show with an open smile.

I remember! 

There is also him.

Heh.

Xiao Chen sensitively noticed that a red-haired boy close by had a pale face. His body’s Yang energy was drained for some reason as if it had been taken away for the most part. Compared with the people around him, his Yang energy was a bit weak in contrast.

This is generally a sign indicating that his end is near. 

The red-haired boy’s gaze did not follow the eyes of everyone around to look at the body lying on the floor, but instead, he tilted his head and looked at the rooftop. It was unclear whether he saw any frightening scene, but he fiercely lowered his head and then gasped for air.

His body trembled uncontrollably like a shaking sieve. His eyes were wide open, and his complexion was ashen.

Xiao Chen has never been nosy and is not curious about the man who died after plunging off a building, let alone wondering what this red-haired man has to do with the incident.

After all. 

All this has nothing to do with him.

He has always been indifferent.

The surrounding area was still emitting various screams because of the shocking scene just now. Some people were even scared to the point that their legs went weak, and they fell on their knees, especially the students standing in the front row who had blood splashed directly onto their hair, faces, and clothes. They even felt a tremor like an earthquake when the body hit the ground.

It’s crazy. It’s crazy. 

He actually jumped.

Xiao Chen had been standing in the far corner. The matter was not his concern, so he turned around, intending to leave the scene.

It goes without thinking that when something of this magnitude happens, suspension of classes is inevitable.

The moment he turned around, his head crashed directly into a broad chest. His nose brushed against the man’s body, and he caught a faint fragrance. 

“…………”

“…………”

The corners of Xiao Chen’s mouth rose upward somewhat uncontrollably as he looked at the man in front of him.

Jing Hezhi’s gray eyes moved, then his large hand directly caught Xiao Chen’s waist. 

The surrounding ghosts of all sizes in at least a 500-meter radius all fled like crazy as if they had seen the king of hell and had to run for their lives.

Even the original eerie chill brought on by the excessive resentment has mostly subsided.

Xiao Chen and the man tacitly glanced at each other and walked towards a place with fewer people.

The moment Jing Hezhi turned to leave, he looked up at the person standing on the rooftop, and his gray eyes were undisturbed, seemingly unconcerned with what had happened. 

In his eyes, they were all like mere ants and playthings.

After walking a few steps, there was no one around.

Xiao Chen immediately hooked his hands around the man’s neck and looked at him playfully, “Why did you get out today?”

Jing Hezhi used his hand to whisk the bangs that blocked Xiao Chen’s eyes to the side. The phoenix eyes that were blocked by the bangs had a smile in the corner, and there was love embedded in these eyes, which suddenly made the man feel a little dry in his throat. 

Want to kiss.

Indeed, he did just that.

Xiao Chen was surprised when the man pinned him to the wall and kissed him on the corner of his right eye without a word. The man even extended his teeth to pretend to bite him twice.

It was a bit difficult to wait for the man to kiss enough before he replied, “I miss you.” 

The reason is really quite simple and straightforward.

It was very much in line with Jing Hezhi.

Xiao Chen licked his lower lip and quietly stared at the man’s eyes.

Jing Hezhi really did not hold back and directly sealed the person’s mouth in front of him. 

Xiao Chen wrapped his arms around the man’s waist.

It was hard to end the kiss. Xiao Chen felt that a layer of his tongue was sucked off. There was also a faint red color on his face.

“Go home.” Jing Hezhi touched the top of Xiao Chen’s hair, and his eyes narrowed vaguely, looking a bit like he desired something.

“Okay, go home.” 

You are my home.

Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. – Marcus Aurelius



“Chen Lulu, Li Jianjun is dead, and your hatred has been served. I beg you to let me go. I was young and ignorant back then when I promised him that I would pretend I didn’t see him hurt you. I beg you, let me go.” 

Ma Yang Yu said this while kneeling on the ground burning paper money. He looked withered as the dark circles under his eyes were heavy like a smoky makeup, and his body was trembling.

The night was terribly cold. It was the summer season, but it was a bit chilly, and there was a harsh wind blowing.

Ma Yang Yu was kneeling on the ground with his legs shaking even more. His face was ashen, and the beads of cold sweat on his temples slid down.

Swoosh! There was a certain sound. 

Ma Yang Yu turned around with a jerk and looked behind him.

The white-bone-like dead tree stood not far away. There were no other buildings, flowers, and plants around it, not to mention the lights. From a distance, it looked like a person was standing there.

Ma Yang Yu stood up with a scuffle as his legs shook even more.

The night was too thick and dark, like the foul blood flowing from a rotting corpse.

Ma Yang Yu was afraid. He immediately grabbed his phone, turned on the flashlight, and intended to leave the site because he was really panicked. He even stumbled a couple of steps and almost broke his foot.

The breeze ruffled his non-mainstream red hair. Ma Yang Yu fiercely widened his eyes as his feet left the ground, and something like a rope loop suddenly strangled his throat. A moment later, Ma Yang Yu’s facial muscles became hideous, and his two hands tried hard to break free of the rope loop strangling his neck, but no matter what they did, it was to no avail.

No! I am still young! I don’t want to die!

Ma Yang Yu’s mouth was forced to open wide, the tip of his tongue was sticking out, and his eyes were widened, like the eyes of a dead fish. 

“Ma Yang Yu! Ma Yang Yu!”

Two yells suddenly came from not far away.

Ma Yang Yu felt the rope binding the neck loosen, and then he fell to the ground with a thud. In a blur, he vaguely saw the figure of a girl in a bloody white dress, with damp black hair hanging down on both sides and with only the whites left in both her eyes.

He fell to the ground like a crazed man, struggling for his life. Both his hands grabbed his throat as if he had not yet recovered from the shock. 

“Ma Yang Yu!” The flashlight’s thin light shone on Ma Yang Yu’s body, and the visitor shouted out in surprise.

The paper money on the side was still burning with flames, and sparks jumped out from time to time.

Li Qiaoyi saw Ma Yang Yu fell to the ground. With a grim expression, he immediately rushed up to hold him, “What’s wrong with you? What are you doing here alone?”

It was also this moment that Li Qiaoyi smelled the scent of blood drifting in the air, and his face suddenly changed. He twisted his head stiffly to look behind him, and then his heart tightened sharply. 

There was a figure standing behind the dead tree.

Her long hair hung to the ground, blocking her face. The wind gently blew her hair, and through the thin moonlight, one could only see a bloodied face with a pair of whitish eyes staring straight at the two.

Li Qiaoyi held his breath. His legs went limp, and he fell to the ground.

But the strange thing is, the next second, the figure disappeared without a trace as if it had never existed. In the blink of an eye, only the lone dead tree was left standing there. 

It was just the eerie wind still blowing.

This was the second time Li Qiaoyi encountered a paranormal event. Two days ago, he was nearly hit by a car when he tried to save a ghostly figure, and today he experienced such a thing again. His heart was about to jump out of his chest.

Li Qiaoyi gulped, looking at the side of the fainted Ma Yang Yu. He took the person on his back and prepared to flee the scene.

He did not see that there was a pair of eyes hiding in the darkness, watching his every move. 

In the quiet night, there was only the sound of Li Qiaoyi’s footsteps, heartbeat, and breathing. This sound was infinitely amplified and frightening in the night………

“Did you hear that a boy at our school suddenly went crazy last night?”

“What crazy?”

“Shh shh, keep it down! Come closer, I’ll whisper it. I heard them say it’s because they saw a ghost!” 

“Ah?”

“You hear me out first, you know the freshman with the red hair, for some reason, he went alone to the grove behind the school yesterday and secretly burned paper money in there. He was found unconscious with a string of strangulation marks on his neck and black palm prints that couldn’t be washed off. When he woke up, he looked like he was stimulated by something and kept shouting, “I was wrong. I’m wrong, I’m wrong, please don’t kill me, this kind of nonsense. Now the school has intervened and arranged a single room for him to take some time off.”

“Black handprint? It must be false rumors from you guys. I don’t believe there are ghosts in this world.”

“No, putting this matter aside, don’t you think that Professor Li jumping from the building is also very weird?” The girl’s voice became smaller and smaller, and she sneakily looked around with an expression like she was a thief and whispered. 

Xiao Chen sat alone in his spot by the window, surrounded by the sounds of discussions disturbing his peace.

He glanced at the girl who was firm on the no-ghost argument and withdrew his gaze.

What that girl didn’t know was that she was actually sitting next to what seemed to be an old man ghost. The old ghost looked at the two with a hateful expression as they gossiped. He waited impatiently for the girl to turn the page so that he could continue to read the contents of the book.

“Tick, tick.” The raindrops hit the glass window. At first, there were one or two drops, then there was a violent storm, and the beads of rain fell rapidly. 

Xiao Chen’s ear tips moved slightly. He raised his head and looked out the window.

The air flowed with Yin energy. The sky outside the window darkened at a speed visible to the naked eye. It was terribly gloomy and almost black with dark clouds. The original clear and bright sky covered with clouds disappeared in a few moments.

Xiao Chen’s left hand propped up his chin. His phoenix eyes slightly narrowed as he stared firmly into the sky outside the window.

The sky looked like it was disconnected. It was clear to see that the sky above the school was still bright, and the sun was still high in the sky, while only a part of the school was wrapped in a layer of dark clouds. The intensity of the storm was so strong that the contrast was striking. 

The surrounding students all exclaimed out loud and then looked out the window.

“Oh my God, what’s going on!”

“What’s wrong with the weather outside, sh*t!”

Xiao Chen used his right hand to turn the ring he was wearing on his left ring finger and fell into deep thought. 

He clearly saw that the school’s Yin energy was like a plague that suddenly erupted and enveloped the entire sky. Even the ghosts from several miles around were like being summoned by something and kept rushing over.

Even the original ghosts around began to be a little restless and started to move around.

“The sky has changed.” Xiao Chen looked at the pendant hanging around his neck and murmured out.

This place is about to turn into a ghostly place filled with evil spirits. 

Those fierce ghosts that have cultivated for a hundred years will transform to a certain degree into a more dangerous ghost. The weather where the ghosts are found is always filled with black clouds, and even the plants are untamed.

Xiao Chen’s expression moved, and his eyes flickered slightly.

Even the human desire will also be infinitely magnified. 

“Hey, do you not have your own pen? Every time you need something, you ask me for it, f*ck off!” 

“You’re fucking sick. It’s just lending a pen, but you make it sound like it is so rare. I’m telling you, the more you do not want to lend, the more I want to take it. I’m just shameless. What can you do to me!” 

“I’ve put up with you for a long time. Are you cheating on me? I saw you walking with a boy yesterday.”

“What do you mean I give you a green hat? Okay, even if it is true, so what? Don’t you look at yourself in the mirror? Look at what you look like. Do you think you are worthy of me? Ridiculous! My mother’s fish pond is not even as bad as you are, a rotten fish! 

All the dark thoughts inside the person, upset emotions, complaints, hatred, disgust, all aroused. 

Xiao Chen was still sitting in place with a blank expression.

“Believe me or not, I’ll kill you!”

“Come on, who’s afraid of who! What a drag!”

The initially quiet library was now like a vegetable market. Everyone started to explode almost at the same time. Their expressions became hideous and unbearable, and their mouths were spitting out profanities and bickering noises. 

At first, it was just a simple argument, but then the quarrel became more and more intense, and within a few minutes, they began to fight each other. After a while, all kinds of hissing screams, curses filled the entire library.

The sound of falling books, the scuffling sound of hitting people, the sound of tables overturned………

The entire place has gone crazy. Everyone’s hostility has been aroused, and their hatred has further aggravated the grievances around them.

There was a fierce storm outside, with the rain splashing on the ground, the leaves, and the windows. One after another, the swooshing gusts of wind almost blew off the trunks of the trees. 

And inside was a chaotic fight between people with cursing and arguing. It was ugly to watch.

Li Qiaoyi looked at the surrounding madness of the students. He was almost hit several times, but fortunately, he dodged quickly. He was distracted because of Ma Yang Yu and was completely confused looking at the crowd that erupted suddenly. 

What’s going on here?

He looked around, and his eyes lit up. 

In the entire library, there was still one person who was not affected by this ghostly weather.

Xiao Chen frowned slightly as he listened to the commotion around him. His expression showed a slight trace of impatience.

And the strange thing was that the surrounding people all seem like they could not see him, or perhaps they were intentionally avoiding him. No one dared to make a scene near where he was sitting. Even when the noise grew more intense, no one ventured to take half a step closer to Xiao Chen’s position.

Li Qiaoyi saw the right moment and rushed to Xiao Chen’s position. 

“You’re not affected either, right?” 

Xiao Chen did not answer but immediately recognized the boy as the one who was nearly hit by a car before and had ghost eyes.

Few people in the world are born with ghost eyes because ghost eyes will only appear in those humans whose Yin energy can rival that of severe ghosts. Still, not everyone who has the condition of having ghost eyes has been stimulated. Most of them, even until death from old age, have never seen a ghost.

Li Qiaoyi saw that his face did not change, and he seemed to have no wavering feelings or even a bit of concern, so Li Qiaoyi smiled a bit awkwardly. 

“The weather will soon change back.” Xiao Chen suddenly spoke out. His tone did not waver in the slightest. It carried a kind of unquestionable certainty that made people who listened to it subconsciously convinced.

When Li Qiaoyi heard these words, there was some suspicion, and he wanted to say something. But in the next second, his eyes dilated, and his entire body paused in place, looking stupidly out the window. 

Xiao Chen’s voice had just stopped. The dark clouds outside the window seemed to be splitting, slowly letting out light. The rain and the wind abruptly stopped, and the dense dark clouds all disappeared in a short while. Even the surrounding gloom slowly dispersed.

It was like a more powerful force had reversed and restored things as before. 

The sunlight passed directly through the glass into the room, shining on Li Qiaoyi’s shoulders. He froze in place with a stunned expression, and his mouth was open in disbelief.

The noise around the room came to a screeching halt as though someone had pressed the pause button. They all froze in place as if they didn’t know what they were doing.

Everything was back as it was. The sky was even brighter and clearer than it was at the beginning.

The corners of Xiao Chen’s mouth rose a bit and quickly collected down. The curve was minimal and not that obvious. 

It’s him coming.




Xiao Chen glanced at the frozen Li Qiaoyi, whose head was accompanied by the female ghost’s Yin energy. The Yin energy seemed to be wrapped around the other’s limbs as if swearing sovereignty. 

Xiao Chen stood up straight, picked up the book on the table, and expressionlessly intended to leave the place.

Li Qiaoyi quickly recovered from the strange change of weather. Seeing that the mysterious boy intended to go, he immediately stood up and followed him. When he thought of the series of strange things that had happened to him recently, as well as Ma Yang Yu, who had gone crazy, he somehow had a feeling that the other party knew something. With an anxious look, he caught up with the other person’s steps and said, “Do you know something? Can you tell me”.

Xiao Chen stopped, turned back, and looked at Li Qiaoyi. The latter stumbled two steps before standing firm. Xiao Chen’s expression was unpredictable, “If you really want to know, she will tell you.”

“She” Li Qiaoyi suspiciously narrowed his eyes. He did not understand the other party’s meaning and faintly frowned, “Who is she?” 

Xiao Chen smiled, and his phoenix eyes raised and looked past his body, without saying a word.

Li Qiaoyi pursed his lips, and his entire body stiffened in place. He could clearly see that the other side’s eyes slowly reflected a white silhouette that was not like a human being but was illusory!

The most important thing is that the white shadow is close to his back, quietly watching himself!

Holy sh*t!!!

Li Qiaoyi seemed as though his body was splashed with a pot of cold ice water. His hands and legs were shivering like he was in an ice cellar. Cold sweat came out from fear, and a scream almost broke out through his throat, but he held himself back.

His head stiffened, his hands were clenched into fists, and his heart thumped violently as if his heart could pop out in the next second.

He moved his head little by little, turning very slowly. His body was still trembling, carrying a bit of desperate courage in it.

The moment Li Qiaoyi turned around, a gust of wind blew, causing him to be slightly confused and made him blink hard. When he opened them again, he was so scared that he instantly covered his mouth. 

The surroundings have not changed, the people have not changed, but there are more things that should not be there.

There were layers and layers of black mist floating in the air. Next to the bookshelves, on the seats, on the tables, and by the windows were all ghosts.

Why is he so sure that they are ghosts?

Because their feet are not stepping on the ground, and their faces are horrifyingly pale, like the color of a person’s dead body that has not yet decayed but has completely lost its muscular luster. There are those who are dragging their limbs, those who are holding their heads, those who are young, and those who are old………… 

Li Qiaoyi’s face went completely white.

There are actually ghosts in this world!

A white figure stood lightly in front of him and locked eyes with him.

Although the girl’s face is also showing a sickly white, it still looks nearly normal. She had a white skirt, simple canvas shoes, and her hair draped over her sides. Her face was also very clean, and she looked as if she was only 13 or 14 years old, like the kind of innocent little sister in the neighborhood. 

But………

Li Qiaoyi let out a deep breath.

She must be a ghost!

He recognized her as the one he had saved last time. 

No, no, it was not the car that hit the ghost, it was him who rushed up and pushed the other side away!

Li Qiaoyi was a little embarrassed. This embarrassment even overshadowed his inner fear of the unknown in front of him. He turned around and wanted to continue to ask Xiao Chen what was going on, only to find that the man standing behind him had left at some point.

Lulu did not get too close to him. She stood at a distance of almost three meters from him. Even all the ghosts around her bypassed the two of them. They did not come close, as if they were deliberately keeping their distance like they were afraid of something.

Lulu looked at the boy in front of her and smiled. She pulled out the brightest smile of her life, revealing her teeth, with the corners of her mouth lifted. Her eyes narrowed with a glow as if she were just a normal little girl. 

Li Qiaoyi looked at her smile. He wavered and was a little speechless for a moment.

But the next second, he felt a stinging pain in his eyes. He subconsciously covered his eyes. When he regained his composure and opened his eyes again, his surroundings were back to their original state.

There was no black fog, no ghosts, much less a little girl in a white dress as though everything he had just seen was just his illusion.

Li Qiaoyi eyes were sharp. He found a newspaper spread on the ground where the girl had been standing. After a pause, he walked forward for some reason and then reached out and picked up the newspaper. 

When he read the contents of the newspaper, the veins on his temples were bulging up straight away.

The newspaper has yellowed, and the layout, typeface, and photos show that the paper is several years old.

The center of the newspaper was marked with an eye-catching headline: Fourteen-year-old girl jumped to her death after being forced/r-ped by her teacher, and spectators roared: “Why aren’t you jumping?”

Li Qiaoyi felt his eyes darken and his legs softening that he almost couldn’t stand still. 

Below the headline was a photo of a girl standing on a rooftop before she jumped, taken by the crowd of onlookers.

Wearing a white dress………

Looking at the photo on the yellowing newspaper, the hand holding the paper could not help but tighten, so the newspaper was instantly clenched into a ball.

To simplify the whole article report, the rough content is that the young girl was often subjected to sexual harassment by her teacher, surnamed Li. On the day of the incident, a student called Xiao Ma heard the girl’s cries for help because he was in detention. However, after police intervention, Xiao Ma denied the matter, resulting in the girl being at the forefront of the storm and without evidence to prove herself. 

The whole trend of public opinion was basically condemning the young girl for not caring for herself. From the perspective of the victim’s guilt theory, the young girl was blamed for the incident and suffered from severe depression. Eventually, the young girl chose to jump off the building. In the process of jumping off the building, onlookers have been shouting words like, “Jump, Jump quickly”.

Li Qiaoyi read the whole article. It was difficult to read, making him feel uncomfortable and even want to vomit blood.

Surnamed Li………

Xiao Ma……. 

Li Qiaoyi stared at the newspaper in a daze, remembering what had happened in school in the past few days. Suddenly a flash of light came over him, his heart jerked a little, and he stared straight up.

Fuck, it can’t be what he thinks it is!

“I just saw the ghost domain!” The old man looked up to the sky. His face was very grave, and his voice was somewhat shaky.

The sky still looked clear and thoroughly blue, seemingly no different than usual. 

“So what?” The one who answered was a young man who looked like he was in his early twenties. His expression revealed an air of superiority over others, and his voice sounded lazy. After hearing the old man’s words, he didn’t put much thought into it. He kept his legs crossed as he sat in his chair and concentrated on the game, not taking the old man’s words seriously.

The old man shook his head as he muttered to himself, “Strange! The ghost domain just appeared not long ago, then disappeared again, as if it was suppressed by some other force.”

The old man took a breath and shook his head, his expression was unsightly, and he questioned himself, “No, that can’t be right! How can that degree of ghost domain be so easily suppressed.”

It was not even that long ago that the ghost domain could be said to have just appeared. It was just a few minutes before it was immediately suppressed. It did not erupt or expand, and the speed and ruthlessness of the situation was just too frightening! 

This is simply impossible.

The appearance of the ghost domain itself is a once-in-a-hundred-year occasion, so how can there be something in this world that can suppress the ghost domain.

“What about it? It could just be that it is not enough, and it has not been formed properly yet.” Lu Yi Ang continued to play the game but could not help but roll his eyes.

Why is there so much going on with the old man? 

“Xiao Yi!!!” The old man took a look at his grandson, who was playing a game without much concern. He frowned and couldn’t help but shout out.

“What,” Lu Yi Ang’s game was at a critical time. When he heard the old man shouting at him, he became a bit annoyed, and in the next second, he was suddenly killed by the other side, so he couldn’t help but curse out, “F*ck.”

The old man sighed in disappointment, “You go call Xiao Ming over. I have something to discuss with him.”

Lu Yi Ang paused, and his expression turned a little ugly. He threw his phone furiously on the sofa and rolled his eyes to the sky. 

This dead old man, how come he only remembers Lu Yi Ming, the illegitimate son who is not even on the stage. It is obvious that he himself is the eldest grandson in this family. Too damn biased!

“Okay, I got it.”

Tsk, I must get rid of this bastard Lu Yi Ming one day.

Heh! 

–

Xiao Chen was lying on Jing Hezhi’s back, half-squinting and looking groggy, trying to fall asleep.

Jing Hezhi’s long hair was on his back, sweat-stained and stuck to Xiao Chen’s chest. Xiao Chen’s head was buried into Jing Hezhi’s neck, rubbing his head in a slight arc and sniffing the man’s scent.

It was like a little puppy trying to determine if he is the master by sniffing. Cute. 

Jing Hezhi gently turned over, shifted his position, and re-embraced Xiao Chen in his arms. Xiao Chen moved in discomfort before finding a comfortable position for himself and continued to lay limp in the man’s arms.

Jing Hezhi lowered his head and stared at Xiao Chen’s face. Xiao Chen’s soft body was attached to the man’s body, with no reservations and no defenses.

The man stared at the other’s tired face and dropped a kiss on his forehead.

The gray eyes shifted obscurely, seemingly harboring many emotions. There was tenderness, there was love, but more than that, there was a bit of paranoia. 

This is his baby!

Jing Wo Zhi’s expression moved slightly as if his brain recalled something suddenly. He exhaled with a sinking feeling and then tightened his arms around Xiao Chen, with one arm around Xiao Chen’s waist and the other acting as his pillow.

Mine! Mine!

The tips of the man’s teeth rubbed against the other’s neck, moving up to the other’s jaw, then the chin…… 

Xiao Chen was tightly confined and couldn’t move easily in the man’s arms.

“Baby, I love you.” Jing Hezhi’s tone revealed a half-hearted hint of reticence.

Xiao Chen was half asleep. When he heard the man’s words in his daze, he subconsciously stretched out his hand and hooked it around the man’s neck. Then he kissed the man several times and replied, “I love you too, I’m too sleepy, don’t bother me. Let me sleep, husband!”

The tone was delicate and full of pampering. 

Jing Hezhi did not say anything and did not bother the child as he slept. His eyes also carried a smile, but his gaze was still fixed on Xiao Chen’s side face as if he was admiring a beautiful work of art.

In the darkness, these gray eyes were staring for who knows how long.

To be precise, he was in such a position admiring his sleeping lover every night.

Finally, Xiao Chen has completely fallen asleep, and the man has resumed putting one mark after another on his lover’s body. 

I’ve waited too long for you! For such a long time!

It was so hard waiting for you!

Never! Never leave me again!

If I can’t find you again, I’ll go crazy! 

–

After the old man finished, he kept staring at Lu Yiming’s face as if he was waiting for a nice answer from the other.

To tell the truth, in his heart, he is more fond of the child Lu Yi Ang than Lu Yi Ming. The child is still his eldest grandson but is really not good, so he does not dare to put the big job into his hands.

Lu Yi Ming pondered for a moment. There was some hesitation and uncertainty before he finally slowly opened his mouth and said, “Could it be that the Ghost King has reappeared in the world?” 

The old man’s eyes widened sharply, and his body almost failed to stand steadily, but fortunately, he did not fall with the support of the wall. The old man’s face was a little ugly, and his heart was horrified, but he could not think of a reason to refute it.

The sky changed dramatically, reversing the state of the universe. In this world, apart from the Ghost King, no one else has been heard of who can have this ability.

The old man’s face was ashen, “The ghost king has been silent for hundreds of years. What do you think is the reason for him to reappear in the world?”

Lu Yi Ming looks too calm and composed. His gaze followed the direction the old man was looking and stared into the distance. 

His tone was evenly neutral and indifferent.

“In search of his lover who has been lost for thousands of years.”

The only passion in my heart is to find you.

All I want for the rest of my life is to hold you in my arms, to bind you to my side, to fuse your flesh and blood with that of mine. 

I absolutely! Absolutely! I cannot stand to lose another minute of you!

So, my dear.

Please don’t leave me again.

Otherwise, I’ll go insane and destroy this world! 



 “Have you found it?” The man dressed in a red robe was sitting on the king’s chair, coldly looking at the rows of spies who were kneeling on the ground, with an uncontrollable expectation in his tone.

The head of the spies clenched his teeth, and moved a step forward on his knees as if he was accepting his death, “Your majesty, we have not found it for the time being.” 

Xiao Chen looked at the scene in front of him with some bewilderment, he was looking around when a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

‘How is he Jing Hezhi?’

After he saw the person in the seat more clearly, he walked over with a smile of joy

However, after two steps, he realised something was amiss. 

The Jing Hezhi in front of him does not seem to be the same Jing Hezhi he remembers, his Jing Hezhi always wore a smile on his face, with genuine tenderness and love in his eyes which could always eliminate all the anxiety and fear of being abandoned in his heart.

But this Jing Hezhi…

something is definitely not right.

His whole body exudes such a level of coldness that would keep all strangers away, his eyes look fierce as if he is ready to kill, such that he can’t even hide the ruthlessness and coldheartedness in his bones.

It was as if Xiao Chen was looking at another Jing Hezhi

But at the same time, Xiao Chen still subtly feels that the Jing Hezhi in front of him was the Jing Hezhi he knew.

The man sneered, his expression reflected the impatience he felt. The body that had been sitting upright leaned lazily on the king’s chair, he didn’t even bother looking at the group of people who were kneeling on the ground, his fingers tapped the edge of the chair lightly.

That symbolised his anger. 

The man waved his hand, and the eunuch who served him walked forward in fear, fearing that he would be decapitated if he did not do a good job.

Jing Hezhi didn’t even bother looking at him and coldly said, “Since all of you have no capabilities, then there is no point for me to keep all of you here anymore.”

The man spoke so monotonously, without even a slight fluctuation in his tone, as if he was saying that today’s weather is not good at all.

“Bring them out, and kill them.” The man’s eyes reflected how coldhearted he was.

So coldhearted that anyone would have been scared.

Xiao Chen froze up, blatantly watching the people who were kneeling on the ground being dragged out by another group of people who rushed in from the door. Soon after, he heard the sound of flowing liquid coming from outside the door and a loud ‘pong’ which sounded like a rock hard item being smashed onto the ground.

However, the man remained emotionless, as if he could kill without even blinking his eyes. 

Xiao Chen grew up seeing so many ghosts and spirits and was completely numb to such scenes of death.

Furthermore, compared to the killing, he was much more curious if the man in front of him was Jing Hezhi.

If he was, then where is he at and why did Jing Hezhi become like that?

Xiao Chen pursed his lips. 

From the moment he stood there, he realized that everyone around him couldn’t see him. He was like a bystander, watching what was happening in front of him. No one knew who he was or where he came from.

No! Something isn’t right!

Xiao Chen paused for a while and cast his eyes on the man sitting in the king’s chair. 

If he truly wanted to know why he was there.

The answer is very straightforward.

He was there for him.

Jing Hezhi stood up from the chair, dragging his seemingly heavy body, and walked out without any expression, with the long red robe dragging across the ground. 

When he walked to the place where Xiao Chen was standing, he paused, as if he had sensed something, he looked around the spot, and his heart twitched violently.

Xiao Chen watched the man stroll back and forth four or five times around where he was standing, staring at where he was standing for a long time as if he knew there was someone standing here. 

Could it be that he saw him?

That was what Xiao Chen thought.

Jing Hezhi endured the sudden tingling of his heart and squeezed his fists. Eventually, his heartless grey eyes sank again, becoming even more empty than at the beginning, with pain.

Then, the man-made up his mind to stop feeling conflicted, turning around while flicking his sleeves and walked away without even looking back. 

He couldn’t find him. He hasn’t found his precious sweetheart.

Xiao Chen was dumbfounded and stayed at his position while watching the man leave, and for some reason, he felt that his back had an unexplainable feeling of loneliness.

Xiao Chen hurried forward.

The man picked up the picture scroll wrapped in cloth on the desk, and then took it out carefully. 

There were a lot of things on the table, and the man frowned. He didn’t know if these things were an eyesore. He violently waved his arm, and slapped all the things on the table to the floor, with a cold face.

The eunuch lady guarding outside the door trembled, but she seemed to be used to it. At this time, no one came in to disturb and no one cleaned up the mess.

Xiao Chen watched him with a face of confusion. 

So violent and so irritable, simply not caring for his own body.

Xiao Chen felt so much pain seeing him act this way, he stopped moving forward, hesitating and did not know what to do.

How could he not recognize the man he loved?

Even though his temperament changed drastically, Xiao Chen is absolutely certain that this person is his Jing Hezhi. 

One and only, unparalleled in the world.

Jing Hezhi flattened the picture scroll and slumped it open on the table. He stared at the person in the picture without saying a word, rubbing his fingers on the drawing paper lightly, as if looking at a fragile and rare piece of treasure.

Seeing him like this, Xiao Chen stepped forward and looked at the painting suspiciously.

What was making him so obsessed? 

Xiao Chen glanced at it and was stunned on the spot.

The painting was not a simple portrait of a beautiful woman!

Xiao Chen blushed, his face flushed red.

That was clearly a sexual scene. 

And it involved two men, one attacking, one receiving.

When Xiao Chen moved in closer and took a better look at the people in the portrait, the bitter feeling flew away immediately.

The young man in the painting has a pair of charming phoenix-shaped eyes, which are slightly raised, flirting with the other guy, and there is a pair of tattoos on his back, a rose and a snake.

The entangled roses and snakes were like the two men entangled in the painting. The love was so deep, no one could pull themself out. They were so in love.

Xiao Chen could not express the unhappiness he was feeling, he could only continue to stare at the man’s every move.

Jing Hezhi placed his fingers on the face of the young man in the painting, looking at the person in the painting affectionately.

“Precious, where are you!” Jing Hezhi was steaming, and even going crazy to a certain extent, “Why can’t I find any news about you even after all these years!” 

Xiao Chen heard the man’s voice and felt bitter and sad. He wanted to rush to give Jing Hezhi a hug, but his hand passed through the man’s body as soon as he stretched it out.

He couldn’t touch him.

Just as if they were in different dimensions.

Xiao Chen’s hand hung in the air, and he slowly clenched his fist, lowering it down. 

This was the first time Xiao Chen felt so powerless.

His teeth were clenched, tightly biting his lower lips.

His lover was just right in front of his eyes, but they could not reunite. They were only a few centimetres apart, but it felt like they were separated by mountains and oceans.

Xiao Chen tried to hug Jing Hezhi as if he was trying to comfort the man. 

“I’m here, Jing Hezhi, I’m right beside you!”

Xiao Chen kept repeating this sentence, looking at the very unstable man in front of him, he couldn’t express the discomfort he felt. Even though he knew that the other party could not hear his own voice at all, he still did it over and over again, because he felt that it was the only way he could convey his emotions to the bottom of the man’s heart.

“I’m here, I’m right beside you.”

I have never left your side. 

And will never leave you too.

Jing Hezhi paused slightly with his hand rubbing on the scroll, and his eyelids twitching suddenly.

He seemed to have sensed something. He stood up, looked around, walked around the desk, walking back and forth a few times.

Why? He was feeling as if he could sense his precious sweetheart! 

The man clenched his fist.

In the end, it was all for nothing, just hallucinations.

He stretched out his fingers to rub his temples.

Precious! Where are you! 

Xiao Chen was like Jing Hezhi’s shadow, wherever Jing Hezhi went, Xiao Chen followed.

Xiao Chen also realised that he couldn’t see any ghosts here, and he was calm just like how the world should have been.

He observed Jing Hezhi’s every move, regardless of day or night, watching how this man was ruining his own body, and how he became so lovesick.

Tyrant! Incapable king! 

That was how everyone called him.

The people under his rule were all suffering.

He was ruthless! Kill without blinking his eyes! Doesn’t bother with any social issues! Doesn’t even ask about politics!

He doesn’t care about the suffering of the people under his rule, and left them to fend for themself. Whenever someone refutes the court, they will be beheaded to scare the public. He will do things his own way, without any care for humanity. 

But just as everyone knew that he was a tyrant, the whole world knew that this man who was even more terrifying than a scourge was focused on looking for someone.

He was looking for a man with a rose and a snake tattoo on his back and had beautiful phoenix-like eyes.

Hilarious! Pathetic! Hated!

The king, don’t even care about his people, and was even gay! 

Going through so much trouble just to find someone from his dream.

It was just a hallucination, an illusion, no one even knew if that person existed!

So many years have passed, yet no news at all!

Why is he so stubborn and can’t let go. 

Time flew past in the blink of an eye.

Xiao Chen found out that he would be jumping to different locations and even different times.

Even though he didn’t feel that time had passed, his lover in front of him is turning sicker and older every passing moment.

Ultimately, he is a mortal, and ageing was inevitable. 

Xiao Chen stood quietly on one side, watching the man age calmly.

The man sat on the chair as if he was dozing off, the beard on his chin also began to appear, and his hair was greying quickly.

On the table laid countless paintings drawn by men.

In the paintings, it was all the same person 

The man in the painting was still so handsome and radiant, young as always, but the man who painted it has long since had greying hair and grew much older.

Xiao Chen squatted down next to the man, leaning closer to observe the changes of the man over the years.

So that was how Jing Hezhi looked when he grew old.

Xiao Chen felt so upset and pitied Jing Hezhi at the same time. 

“Your Majesty, the attacking traitors are already near the city, please leave now.” It was Li Gui, the old eunuch who had been serving Jing Hezhi. He rushed into the study and knelt down straight away.

Jing Hezhi opened his eyes faintly, looking at the kneeling man, his grey eyes had not changed in any way from when he was young, cold and ruthless, without even the slightest fluctuations.

He could hear the distant sound of swords and killing, and even the pitiful screams of the court ladies and eunuchs as they were being killed.

Chaotic and tragic. 

“Where do I go?” the man sneered, “in a world without him, where else could I go?”

No one knew clearer than Xiao Chen who the ‘him’ Jing Hezhi was referring to.

Before Li Gui could convince him, the study’s door was brutally kicked open with so much force that a loud ‘pong’ sound accompanied.

Xiao Chen stood up immediately, and his pupils were dilated. 

When the person who charged in saw the man sitting on the chair, his eyes became sharp and smiled triumphantly. He held a long sword in his hand with the tip of the sword stained with fresh blood, so much so that some of the blood flowed down the sword onto the floor.

The person stabbed Li Gui, who struggled for a short while before breathing in his last breath.

Yet Jing Hezhi remained emotionless and reflected no sense of fear.

Xiao Chen was so anxious and loudly screamed, “Jing Hezhi, are you mad? Why aren’t you standing up yet, don’t you want to see me, I’m right beside you! Stand up now!” 

But no matter how loudly Xiao Chen screamed, Jing Hezhi remained emotionless.

In a world where his lover did no exist, suicide has crossed the man’s mind countless of times, his only hope was that he could find his lover.

But having lived to now, he barely had any hope left.

The attacker was so suspicious of how emotionless Jing Hezhi was, he held up his sword but didn’t dare to step forward. 

After a slight hesitation, the man mustered up his courage and stabbed Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen’s pupils shrunk suddenly, as he tried to shield the man’s body with his hands, and used himself to block the man’s body, but the long sword still went straight through his body and penetrated towards the heart of the man without any hindrance.

The attacker stabbed so violently that blood splattered everywhere.

Right before Jing Hezhi was stabbed, his bleak grey eyes seem to have seen something unbelievable, he tried to reach out his hand to touch the man before his eyes. 

It was his precious sweetheart!!

But when the sword was completely pulled out of his chest, he also lost all his energy and took his last breath.

Xiao Chen stood dumbfounded in his spot, looking at the scene in front of him at a loss.

All of the sudden, his teary eyes froze, without even a blink, he watched the man’s soul leave his body, becoming a spirit, appearing right in front of his eyes. 

The man looked exactly like how he was when he was young, in his peak with a red robe and green lace, exactly like how Xiao Chen remembered him.

Jing Hezhi obviously did not expect things to turn out this way and stared right at Xiao Chen, he stepped forward and raised his hand, trying to touch Xiao Chen to check if it was just an illusion.

Xiao Chen throbbed, trying to hug him, but before he could even move, a strong force suddenly restricted his movement and pulled him backwards, before he completely disappeared from his original position.

“NO!” Jing Hezhi exclaimed out loud. 

He totally did not just see his lover disappearing right in front of his very eyes yet again!

Why! WHY!

The man’s grey pupil became blood red, with anger overwhelming his brain, a gust of black air rushed out of his body soaring to the sky, just like a crazy beast that had completely lost any rationality.

At that moment, the weather changed, the originally sunny day was all of a sudden clouded by dark clouds, just like the solar eclipse. The sun was covered by a gust of black energy and then devoured. 

There was only complete darkness left.

Not a single spark of light.

All the court ladies, eunuchs and soldiers became ghosts and began killing the traitors who attacked.

In the dark. 

The smell of blood consumed the whole place, which was endlessly painted red.

The violent screams of ghosts filled with hatred filled the place.

The king of the ghosts!

He was born! 

Return him to me! Return him to me! Return my precious sweetheart back to me!

Go and die! All of you go and die!

No one will be spared!

Xiao Chen opened his eyes abruptly from the darkness, staring at Jing Hezhi, who had been staring at him, and took a deep breath,he suddenly stretched out their hands and tightly hugged his neck, burning his head in Jing Hezhi’s neck in fear that they will be separated again. 

The man laughed and patted the kid’s back lightly, “what happened, did you have a nightmare?”

Xiao Chen sniffled, he had yet to recover from the fear of seeing Jing Hezhi being stabbed, he took another deep breath and rubbed the man’s neck.

The kid doesn’t usually call Jing Hezhi by his full name. 

“Why, what’s wrong?” The man hugged the kid tightly.

“I will never ever leave you again!”

Every time Xiao Chen remembers the look of despair on the man’s face when he disappeared, his heart would ache.

When the man heard those words, his grey eyes changed and had a look of confusion. 

The next moment, he buried his head in the kid’s hair and calmly said,” Of course, I know”

Because I will never ever let anyone take you away from my side.

You! Are mine!


 The old man was silent for a moment, clearing his throat, “If he really is the ghost king, if he wants to make a comeback and re-enter the chaos, there is no one in this world who can defeat him.”

Lu Yiming laughed when he heard the words, and the corners of his mouth rose slightly, with a bit of mockery. “How do you know that he will be?” 

The old man could hear the disdain in his voice, and felt weird, but he thought he was thinking too much so he forced down the thought. He explained, “Jinghe is the king of the country. The brutality raged during that political period. On the day of the fall of the country, he was stabbed to death with a sword and turned into a ghost. The sky changed dramatically, the sun and the moon eclipsed, it rained blood for three days and three nights. The entire capital, no matter if the people were innocent or they were rebelling, they all died overnight. For thousands of years, he has been the only one in the world who has been able to wander for so long and not disappear.”

Lu Yiming calmly stared at the old man, “He has been on earth for thousands of years. If he actually wanted to cause chaos, the world would definitely be in trouble, so why wait till today?”

He didn’t mean to refute, he was simply stating the facts.

The old man remained silent. 

Lu Yiming looked away from the old man, “It was always a cause and effect relationship between humans and ghosts. Although they live on the same land and under the same sky, they don’t bother each other.”

The old man frowned. He thought those words were absurd and ridiculous. “Do not disturb each other? If they really just do not disturb each other, then why do we exist?”

Lu Yiming’s eyes did not change.

Are ghosts the scariest things on Earth?

No, it’s the human heart!

Not everyone can become a ghost after death, not every ghost can live forever, let alone that every ghost will hurt people.

All ghosts that hurt people will be punished by the rules, will face backlash, and will eventually experience the pain of having the skin peeled, their muscles cramping, their souls leaving for good.

If it weren’t for deep-seated hatred, how could ghosts just casually harm people? 

It was a cause-effect relationship, those people deserved it.

Ah.

Lu Yiming stood indifferently and didn’t utter a word.

“Bring Xiaoang to investigate this matter,” In the old man’s heart, he was ultimately worried for his eldest grandson. 

“For nearly a hundred years, grievanced ghosts have been running around and indiscriminately killing innocents. The best way to maintain peace between the two worlds of humans and ghosts without disturbing each other would be to find the ghost king and make a deal with him.” The old man said sincerely.

Otherwise, if this continues, the secrets of the ghosts cannot remain hidden.

Lu Yiming was silent for a moment, and finally opened his lips, “I know.”

“You were scolded by your grandpa today,” As soon as Lu Yiming walked into his room after handling everything and closed the door, he heard someone talking, but strangely, no one was to be seen at all. 

Lu Yiming took out the charm from his pocket, muttered something in his mouth, and then made gestures on the charm with his fingers, without any change in his expression.

The surrounding scenes changed instantly.

Lu Yiming’s eyes were as if they had been opened, and he could clearly see things that ordinary people couldn’t see.

The man in bathrobe-style clothes was lying on the bed with his chest bare open, one hand on his chin, and some hair covering his eyes. The man’s face was very white. To be precise, every part of the man’s body was white, he looked at most twenty-five or six years old. 

Had it not been for the wisps of yin on his body that made it hard for a monk to ignore, in the eyes of ordinary people, this might be just another ordinary man, but then again, if you don’t believe in Tao, or don’t have your ghost eyes opened, how could ordinary people be able to see ghosts?

Lu Yiming didn’t answer the man’s words, nor did he show any sense of discomfort because a man suddenly appeared in the room, instead, he seemed to be used to it.

Lu Yiming took off his outermost coat and threw it on the hanger next to him. He pulled his tie with his hands, looking a bit retched.

With a smile, the man admired the beauty in front of him who was undressing with relish, the collar in front of his chest was opened wider, and his posture was looking more and more attractive.. 

Lu Yiming took off his shoes, sat directly on the bed, and then laid down right beside the man.

The man laughed, as if he wanted to do something, he leaned forward with excitement. Before the man could touch the corner of Lu Yiming’s clothes, Lu Yiming pulled off the quilt and got below it in one go.

“…”

“Sleep!” Lu Yiming adjusted his pillow. 

Why is he not even the least bothered?

Boring!

The man snorted with a little frustration.

Suddenly, the man seemed to have thought of something. He pulled out a scroll from behind which he didn’t even know where he got it from. Then he threw it viciously on Lu Yiming’s body and said fiercely, “Admit it, you still like this type?” 

Lu Yiming opened his eyes, glanced at what the man had thrown on him, and then closed his eyes again, with no intention of replying to him at all.

The man became even angrier and kicked Lu Yiming aggrievedly. “Playboy!”

Lu Yiming’s eyes were still closed, and he said faintly, “That’s the ghost king’s lover.”

He thought the man could read between the lines. However, the man just paused for three seconds, then his eyes widened, and he exclaimed, “F*ck, how dare you like the ghost king’s lover?” 

OK, maybe it’s better not to explain.

Time to go to sleep.

The wind blew heavily against the treetops, making a whirring sound. In the inky night, no one could make out what was in the darkness, only a vague outline of the surrounding trees.

The lights in the teaching building were all turned off, and the windows were crackling because of the blowing wind, adding a bit of mystery to the lifeless teaching building. 

Only the dim lights from the stairs at the end of each section of the corridor were still on. No one had any idea how long the lights were there, they were always flashing and there was an occasional buzz due to the flow of current.

Suddenly, a few mysterious figures sneaked in through the back door of the teaching building quietly, moving lightly but quickly.

It was a group of students, two guys and two girls.

The girl at the end of the group tied two ponytails and looked really timid, she was also really thin and appeared weak. She was tightly clutching the shirt of the guy right in front of her, when she whispered, “We’re really going to the roof? I am so scared.” 

The other girl looked more arrogant and even despotic, she glanced back at the girl with two ponytails who was afraid of every movement, and sneered, “If you are so afraid, why follow us? Don’t think I don’t know what you are thinking about!”

“Hey, hey. Stop talking. Our purpose tonight is to verify whether the rumours are true, and not to quarrel.” The boy in the lead scolded, and then glanced back the next instant, half of his face was hidden in the darkness, “I heard that since Li Jianjun died, some classmates saw a white ghost on the roof the past few nights. We’re here today to verify if it’s true!”

The boy’s expression was somewhat contemptuous, and it seemed that he was not interested in ghosts, maybe he is there out of pure curiosity.

A group of people walked through the corridor and climbed up the stairs lightly, the function of the mobile phone flashlight shining a meagre light, and the four of them climbed up to the roof without hindrance. 

However, the gate of the rooftop has been locked by the school. Since the suicide incident, the school has been more stringent than before.

The boy walking behind seemed to be an expert in lock picking. He took out a piece of tin foil, which was about four centimetre long and a steel wire that seemed to be from a keychain ring.

Biting his phone in his mouth, standing in front of the lock, he twisted his body in awkward positions while his companions watched his series of operations.

With a “click”, the door opened. 

The boy couldn’t help but sneer.

Pushing the door open, the four of them walked out and looked around. Everyone seemed disappointed..

The whole place was nothing but flat ground. They looked up only to realize that even the moon was not out tonight, and it was pitch black.

Everyone was left speechless. 

“Chey, I thought there would be something! Such a waste of my time, there’s nothing here at all.” The girl rolled her eyes.

The boy who was leading them also began to curse, swearing in his mouth, only the girl with ponytails remained silent from beginning to end, standing stiffly on the spot, her face was very pale, and beads of sweat were sliding down her forehead.

Seeing her like this, the other girl thought that she was just pretending to be weak, and was annoyed by her pretense. She folded her hands on her chest and sneered, “Look at yourself, even this scares you.”

The girl with two ponytails still didn’t dare to speak, as if she just realised what was going on, she continued to hide behind the boy who opened the lock, trembling, and said quietly, “Let’s leave quickly.” 

Anyway, there was nothing on the roof, it’s boring, so they just left.

The girl with two ponytails looked ill, but at the moment when she stepped out of the roof she couldn’t help but look behind her once more, and she started trembling again.

She saw a female ghost in white standing there, her face was like chopped lean pig meat, her facial features were blurred, her long hair was draped down the sides, and her hand was holding the neck of another male ghost, the male ghost kneeling on the ground with a struggling look, like an ant that could not resist. The moment the door closed, the eyes of the double ponytail met the completely white eyeballs of the female ghost, and she almost screamed in fright.

After finally leaving the teaching building, the girl with two ponytails took a deep breath, but her body continued to tremble, her teeth were chattering, and there was a chill down her back. She raised her head slightly to look at the rooftop, thinking of what she just witnessed. 

That male ghost…

is the dead Professor Li…

Xiao Chen took off his shoes and stepped barefoot on the cool floor. The coolness penetrated through his feet and then his whole body. He took off his pants indifferently, and casually hung them on the clothes rail next to them.

Shaking his hair, unbuttoning his shirt one by one from top to bottom with one hand. 

Xiao Chen dipped his hand into the bathtub to test the temperature of the water, and felt that it was just right. He stepped in with his two white legs and sat down slowly, until his whole body was lying in the bathtub, feeling the warmness of the water and relaxing his muscles.

Perhaps he was really tired, his eyelids grew heavier the longer he was in the bathtub.

Xiao Chen, who had fallen asleep, was awakened by the sound of splashing water, and seemingly saw someone stepping into the bathtub.

It was Jing Hezhi… 

Jing Hezhi flung his robe and threw it on the ground. Fortunately, this bathtub is large enough to fit two full-grown men.

Xiao Chen adjusted his posture to make space for the man to lie down.

However, Jing Hezhi directly laid towards him, with their skins touching each other. Just when Xiao Chen was confused, the man turned around, swapped his posture with Xiao Chen, so that the other party would lie on him.

Xiao Chen did not struggle during the whole process, and lay down obediently. 

The man bit the child’s ear, squinted his eyes, and Xiao Chen didn’t know what he had thought of. He opened his mouth lightly, with a sense of coaxing, “From tomorrow onwards, I will accompany you to school.”

Xiao Chen hooked the man’s neck, smiling with much affection and muttered softly, “Okay.”





 “Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” Ma Yangyu trembled, hiding and burying his head under the quilt, curled up into a ball in a fetal position.

He was at the brink of collapse, and his face was very pale. It was so obvious that he had not slept peacefully for several days. 

‘Drip, Drip.’

It was the sound of water dripping on the ground. It was very abrupt and terrifying in the quiet night. There was no toilet or even a sink in the room. The sudden sound of water scared Ma Yangyu, and he trembled even harder.

All the lights in the room were turned on and he had locked the door too. He even blocked the entrance with a cabinet taller than a human. Even the windows were covered with a layer of cloth, which had a statue of Zhong Kui painted on it, no one knew where he learnt of this folk exorcism method.

Garlic, some weird spells and an abacus were all hung down the doorway. 

‘Jingle.’ The Teru Teru Bozu which was hung on the door was rustled by the wind.

Ma Yangyu was shivering even more intensely.

“Please, Lulu, let me go, I know I was wrong, I really realized my mistake! I kowtow to you!” Once Ma Yangyu finished talking, he shrank under the quilt and smashed his head on the mattress. There was a banging sound on the hard bed board of the school dormitory, and the bed board also shook very badly.

Ma Yangyu was shaking as if he was a sieve, which was shaking to strain flour through, and with his head covered, he was sweating profusely. The sweat dripped down his forehead and onto his lips, flowing continuously.

“Forgive me, I really know that I was wrong.” Ma Yangyu’s lips spasmed, his teeth were chattering, and his voice was trembling.

With a ‘pop’, the light bulb in the room suddenly flashed and dimmed.

Ma Yangyu was so frightened by the sound that his eyes were about to pop out, and his eyeballs moved slowly from side to side. He was like a statue, motionless, as if scared and stunned in place. He was even breathing slowly, so nervous that he held his breath.

In the darkness, you can only hear the crackling sound of the Teru Teru Bozu being blown by the wind, the sound of water droplets on the floor, and the pounding sound of Ma Yangyu’s own heartbeat. 

These small sounds were infinitely amplified by the silent night.

However, a full minute passed, and the expected paranormal incident did not happen.

Two minutes followed…

As time passed, the wind stopped and the sound of water droplets disappeared. Only Ma Yangyu’s breathing and heartbeat remained, filling up the whole room. 

Ma Yangyu’s body did not stop trembling because of this. Instead, his brain started to ache because he was in a highly tense situation, especially at the position of his temples. He could even feel blood being pumped through his veins.

And his knees were a little numb because he kept the same posture for such a long time.

He doesn’t know how long has passed, Ma Yangyu lifted up a corner of the quilt to scan the surrounding environment through the small gap testingly.

Nothing. There was nothing at all. 

Ma Yangyu breathed a sigh of relief, squeezed his hands into a fist, with his fingers tightly clenched. He did not relax because of this.

His chest started to rise and fall more quickly, and he began to breathe normally, greedy for the fresh air around him, after all, he almost suffocated himself by holding his breath.

“Amitabha, Amitabha.” He covered back the little quilt that he lifted up , and his mouth kept repeating Amitabha, as if Nile Bodhisattva would jump out to protect him.

Although he also knew that this was nothing more than psychological comfort. 

He shut his eyes tightly, buried his head under the pillow, continued to cover his head with the quilt, curled his whole body into a ball, his mouth was constantly repeating, constantly to comfort himself and psyching himself up, as if as long as he survives this long night, there will be no more female ghosts harassing him.

After a long time had passed, and Ma Yangyu fearfully opened his eyes again, as if thinking that there will be no more female ghosts to harass him tonight, he lifted his head from the pillow.

“Ahhhhh! !” A scream cut across the sky.

The pillow that Ma Yangyu was using to cover his face was not a pillow after all! 

As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a bloody face appear on the pillow. The owner of that face opened his mouth and grinned. It had bloody teeth with a sincere but creepy smile.

It was Chen Lulu!

“Ahhhhh!!”

He just laid on Chen Lulu’s face for half a night! 

Ma Yangyu went completely crazy.

“Lu Yiming, we are not on the same side. You do what you want and I look for my own thing.” Lu Yi Ang has always been arrogant and dominating, and this time was no exception. It was originally an important task that his grandfather had assigned him, and he simply called a group of people to come, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Lu Yiming looked at a group of vibrantly coloured heads behind him. Men were either wearing leather clothes or leather pants or denim punk, dirty braids, and women were all in miniskirts with heavy makeup. Their looks really didn’t suggest that they were investigating ghosts, instead, they looked like they were having fun in a nightclub. 

“Whatever you want.” Lu Yiming nodded indifferently. He didn’t even look at Lu Yi Ang. He didn’t want to be with Lu Yi Ang. It wasn’t that he had a grudge against Lu Yi Ang. On the contrary, it was Lu Yi Ang who had strong feelings against him. To the extent that he can’t wait to strangle him. If there was such a chance, he felt that Lu Yi Ang wouldn’t even hesitate to stab him.

However, he has always been too lazy to go along with what Lu Yi Ang said, so he doesn’t even bother with his instructions.

Lu Yi Ang didn’t have the ability to bring him down, much less the brains.

Lu Yiming and Lu Yi Ang contacted the principal of this haunted school with the help of the Ghost Relief Bureau. Although they didn’t explain the truth and were vague about it, they still managed to become fake substitute teachers so that it would be much more convenient to investigate. 

“I’m going to class.” After Lu Yiming finished speaking, he walked away without looking back, leaving Lu Yi Ang standing with the group of coloured heads.

Lu Yi Ang chuckled, looking at Lu Yiming’s shrinking back, and, feeling very uncomfortable, snorted dismissively, “F*ck, he really thinks he is a teacher.”

Lu Yiming has always been a meticulous person. Even if he was just a fake substitute teacher, he prepared for lessons early. This has always been his style of work and he has never done things carelessly.

“Ma Yangyu. ” Lu Yiming was going through the information in his mind again, analysing the recent strange accident in school, softly reading his name out, still looking indifferent. 

His primary purpose now was to investigate this person.

From the moment Lu Yiming’s feet stepped into the gate of the school, his eyes were fixed on the position of the roof of the teaching building, and he kept observing the surroundings.

Sure enough, the number of ghosts in this school was higher than that of others. There are a lot of terrible places, it can be said to be ten times, even a hundred times more horrible.

Especially the ghosts with more grievances, there were so many of them, even when compared to the hospitals. He didn’t even need to use any spells to open his own ghost eyes to feel the strong sense of resentment and grievances. It was very abnormal. 

Lu Yiming observed the actions in front of him. Although the number was a bit appalling, their behaviour was still relatively normal.

Suddenly, as if Lu Yiming had discovered something, he paused slightly after taking a step towards the teaching building, and couldn’t help but look at the boy who had just walked into the school on his side, and he was stunned in place.

The boy wore a plain white shirt and jeans with his back straight, and his face was extremely white. His facial features were also very definite, just like a work of art carefully carved by God. The pair of phoenix shaped eyes looked like it had a lot of stories, complementing his already beautiful face. As long as he walks among the crowd, he will definitely be the focus of the crowd.

Of course, this was not the reason why Lu Yiming noticed him, because the Yin energy radiating from this boy was so heavy that it was hard to ignore. The degree of Yin energy would definitely be a good tonic for the grieving ghosts, enough to make all ghosts rushing to him to satisfy their appetites. 

But all the grieving ghosts around him evaded subconsciously when he appeared. They also made a special way for him, as if they were afraid of getting too close to him, even their expression was a little scared.

As a ghost exterminator, he had never seen anything before, and the scene before him was simply unheard of.

Lu Yiming frowned and stared at the boy’s face, but before he could stare for more than ten seconds, he suddenly felt heart palpitations, his heart throbbed so badly, and his entire face became distorted due to the immense pain.

His muscles weakened and almost caused him to fall to the side. Fortunately, he managed to support himself on the wall in time. 

A very powerful force came from nowhere, and attacked him directly, making him instantly feel as if he was bearing the weight of Mount TaiShan. It felt like a ghost was crawling out from the ground and grabbing his ankle to take him to hell. That sense of weightlessness felt as if he was free falling.

Lu Yiming breathed a sigh of relief, and his pupils dilated, he just regained awareness and his usually emotionless face only reflected discomfort, as if he had not fully regained control over his body.

‘Ha.’

Lu Yiming felt as if he heard a sneer, this sneer was a bit ethereal, and before he could adjust his state of mind, an unpretentious voice rang out of thin air in his ears, “Remember, keep your eyes to yourself and don’t look randomly!” The voice paused, a little casual, “Am I right, ghost exterminator?” 

The voice was very low and bewitching, and very hoarse, but what was said hit Lu Yiming’s heart directly, and it made him breathless and completely crushed him.

Next was another sneer that caused a chill to run down his spine.

Xiao Chen noticed something, glanced at Lu Yiming, but didn’t pay attention to it.

Although he was still expressionless as usual, there was joy between his eyebrows. It was not difficult to tell that Xiao Chen was in a good mood today. 

Xiao Chen’s right hand kept caressing the pendant hanging on his neck, and the corner of his mouth almost gave him away a few times, almost rising.

No one knew how Jing Hezhi turned into a necklace so that he could follow Xiao Chen out.

“So happy? “The man’s voice sounded in his ears, with a hint of ridicule, but the tone was unabashedly pampering and joyful.

The man undoubtedly enjoys the direct expression of his love for him. 

He liked how the child was so straightforward, so much so that it could always fill up his heart even when he was insecure, just like an endless pit of biasness.

Sure enough, Xiao Chen’s hand continued to rub the chainsaw pendant in his palm gently, with joy between his eyebrows, he bluntly replied, “Of course!”

As the old saying goes, no one knows how they fell in love, but they still love deeply.

He loves Jing Hezhi, no doubt about that. 

The man’s originally unhappy thoughts were completely swept away by Xiao Chen’s simple words. Even though Xiao Chen didn’t know the impact of his words, Xiao Chen knew the man was also feeling good from the mutual telepathy.

“Jing He Zhi. ”

“Huh? “The man’s voice rose up, with a bit of teasing, “Why did you not call me husband?”

Right after he said that, the young man who was known for being expressionless, started to blush, and it was so shameful for him. 

It was all Jing Hezhi’s fault for always harassing him like crazy when he was sleeping.

Only after he takes the initiative to send him a kiss and to call him “husband” will the other side reluctantly let him off.

Of course, for the other indescribable time, when he called “husband”, he would be digging his own grave, because the man was more excited at those times.

Can’t take the risk, can’t take the risk. 

Xiao Chen looked around and sighed, making sure that no one around was paying attention to his every move. With his index finger and thumb, he held up the pendant, paused, and printed a kiss on the pendant..

“Don’t cause trouble, let’s continue after we reach home.”

Afterwards, Xiao Chen loosened his grip on the pendant and continued to walk forward blankly. He was back to the expressionless face.

However, only Jing Hezhi noticed that his child’s ears had completely turned pink. 

Lu Yiming didn’t know how long he had been standing there for. Even when the class bell rang, he stood in a daze and didn’t move. His eyes were dull.

The feeling of being crushed just now gave him a sense of disillusion.

It was just like he walked around hell and then the King of Hades let him off mercifully before fleeing back to Earth hurriedly.

Lu Yiming has photographic memory. He gritted his teeth, forcing himself to carefully recall the appearance of the boy who had just walked past, because he knew that this was definitely the most important clue to him. 

Finally, Lu Yiming, who had just taken a step forward, his pupils shrank suddenly, and his brain paused for a short time.

He finally remembered why seeing that face would give him an indescribable sense of familiarity!

Lu Yiming took a deep breath.

The boy looked exactly the same as the one in the Ghost King painting! 

Lu Yiming’s thoughts just popped into his mind, but when he thought of it further, his subconscious was telling him that it was absolutely impossible.

But no matter how much he didn’t want to admit it, the facts seemed to be right in front of him.

If all his conjectures were true, who threatened him just now?

A corner of Lu Yiming’s mouth raised, and he looked worse than if he was crying. 

The answer was obvious and unquestionable!

It was the man he grew up only seeing in the books, the number one person in the world who has the ability to sweep autumn leaves with wind.

The king of ghosts…

Jing Hezhi! 

Lu Yiming did not know if he was supposed to laugh now.

After all, the purpose of this job was to find the King of Ghosts.

But at this moment, he could not laugh even when he wanted to.

The fear which completely dominated him just now had also completely destroyed the arrogance he had for so many years. 

He used to think that he was a genius for monkhood.

It was ridiculous!

But in front of Jing Hezhi, harming Lu Yiming seemed to be easier than killing an ant.

Thinking about this, Lu Yiming’s face became completely pale.





 “Why do you want to help me?” The blood stains on the face of the ghost in a white skirt have become deeper and deeper. Not only her face, but her whole body was almost falling apart, and her body was covered with raw knife scars, and the smell of blood on her body was getting stronger.

This was the end that all grieving ghosts must go through after trying to get revenge on others. She won’t last long, and her body will turn into a pool of blood and finally dissipate from the world. 

She has known her end from when she took the first step.

Jing Hezhi didn’t even look at her, staring straight ahead, and said indifferently, “Just do what you need to do.”

Which subtly meant to not ask what she should not ask.

The female ghost did not dare to refute, she felt a sense of absolute crushing pressure and obedience in front of Jing Hezhi. 

In the next second, the man left just like how he came, as if a gust of wind dissipated in front of the female ghost.

Lulu stood still on the spot, looking at the full-length mirror in front of her, her brows and eyes could not hide the disgust.

She was once a young girl with a gorgeous body and a beautiful face.

Unexpectedly, right after that, her face began to slowly recover at a speed visible to the naked eye, from the unevenness of minced meat to a normal face, and the original skin which was covering her dropped to the floor.

She looked at this familiar face through the mirror and touched it with her hand. It was very smooth.

She lowered down her head and looked at her body, her arms, her thighs… All the wounds were beginning to heal.

Lulu covered her mouth and nose with an indescribable bitterness.

If one had the choice, which girl would be willing to make her face unsightly, and who would be willing to endure the pain of bones and skins to hurt others? 

What she wanted has always been revenge, and the wicked must be punished.

“Hey,” Li Qiaoyi’s (the one who tried to save lulu from the car crash earlier, only to realize that no one was there.) eyes brightened after seeing someone at the corner. He immediately shouted and rushed out, blocking Xiao Chen’s path.

Xiao Chen stopped and looked Li Qiaoyi up and down a few times. He immediately recognized who he was, but he still didn’t say a word. He just looked at Li Qiaoyi’s eyes quietly, as if asking, are you looking for me? 

Li Qiaoyi pursed his lips, the dark circles under his eyes were heavier than before, and the eye sockets were also a little more sunken. His whole person seems to be kind of depressed, how could he be the same vigorous and positive person when they first met.

“There are really ghosts in this world, right?” Li Qiaoyi asked very carefully, even hesitating to say this sentence.

Li Qiaoyi always felt that he was dreaming about the experience that day, but the newspaper he was holding on that day was absolutely real, and even that copy was still stuffed in his school bag.

In order to ascertain the truth of the matter, he visited many places, found a lot of waste recycling shop owners, and asked a lot of people to find the same publication, but the results obtained showed that the incident really happened that year. 

He couldn’t believe it at first, but later he went to question Ma Yangyu, and watched Ma Yangyu look more crazy and even more terrible after hearing what he said. How couldn’t he understand that the person in the newspaper was him?

But after so many years of compulsory education, he learned Marxism which promoted the core values ​​of socialism, advocated the theory of innocence, and emphasized science. After living for so many years like that, he suddenly realized that the ghosts really existed in this world, which was hard for him to digest for a while. This is simply putting his beliefs and values on the ground and rubbing them repeatedly, and then putting them back together.

Xiao Chen tilted his head, rubbing his fingers with the ring on the pendant, and said faintly, “Don’t you have an answer in your heart?”

Why did he even need to ask him? 

Li Qiaoyi’s expression showed a struggling look, his facial features were all scrunched together, and he continued to ask in a hoarse voice, “Is Ma Yangyu going to die?”

Ma Yangyu has now been completely tortured like crazy, he didn’t even dare to look at people, any disturbance will cause him to collapse like a frightened bird.

When he first went to see Ma Yangyu, he was also turned away by the other party. Ma Yangyu didn’t even eat any food, and became haggard at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Xiao Chen glanced at him strangely, was silent for two seconds, and replied, “No.” 

That was the truth.

Li Qiaoyi’s dim eyes lit up in an instant, as if a pool of dead lake water suddenly came to life, “Really?”

Li Qiaoyi began to stammer, without making any sense, “Then he, wrong, then me, no.”

He took a deep breath, as if he didn’t know how to articulate his thoughts, and as if he had thought of something, he asked anxiously, “Then, then that ghost won’t bother him.” 

Xiao Chen looked at Li Qiaoyi’s anxious look, as if he understood what Li Qiaoyi was thinking, he hooked his mouth, “I can’t confirm that.”

From the beginning, Chen Lulu never thought of killing Ma Yangyu. She did hate him and hated him for not testifying for her, but of course she also knew that Ma Yangyu was not guilty to be punished by death. At that time, Ma Yangyu was just a child, and he had indeed been confessing for so many years.

But despite this, she still hates him. She is still not reconciled! Her logical thinking cannot convince her.

She tortured Ma Yangyu’s nerves, appeared in the middle of the night to frighten him, but didn’t kill him, leaving him tortured. 

She killed the beast teacher, but still did not let him off.She made the man who finally became a ghost experience the same death repeatedly in the same place, just like a Mobius Strip ring, over and over again.

Li Qiaoyi’s face was instantly pale, his expression was uglier than crying, and his lips trembled, “When will she let him go?”

Xiao Chen said earnestly, “Maybe if you communicate with her, she will let Ma Yangyu off.”

Li Qiaoyi looked at him suspiciously, Xiao Chen’s fingers still rubbing the necklace, and continued, “From today, you will be by Ma Yangyu’s side at night, and you will be able to communicate with her when the ghost is there.” Xiao Chen paused, “She will definitely listen.” 

After all, Li Qiaoyi did indeed save her life in some sense.

There is nothing more to say about it.

Li Qiaoyi stood there and looked at Xiao Chen’s leaving back, his whole person was still dazed.

Jing Hezhi glanced at Li Qiaoyi faintly, and silently hooked up the corner of his mouth. 

All his memories were restored.

In every world, he would lose his own memory. If it weren’t for his love and persistence for Xiao Chen, he would not be able to survive till now.

After experiencing so many worlds, he finally discovered the laws of these worlds and found a way to escape.

He realized that the world he and Xiao Chen lived in might not be real at all, but had a fixed plot development and even a specific background. In addition, he also had an amazing discovery. In these thousands of worlds, every world has a darling favored by the rules. 

Xu Gaohan in the first world, Liang Jing in the second world, Ma Chenggong in the third world, Wang Yeze in the fourth world, Xu Caitong in the fifth world…

and in this world.

Li Qiaoyi!

They will be especially loved by the world. 

He struggled to become the ghost king and became a special existence outside the rules of the world, so he knew the development of this world foreseeably.

And also knew the whole plot.

Jing Hezhi squinted slightly when he thought of this.

And when the plot line of this world reaches the end, then the laws will loosen the control of these worlds, and he and Xiao Chen can escape through this gap. 

And now, they have accumulated the energy they needed to escape, only the last step is left.

Waiting for the end of the plot.

This is a decision he has planned for a long time and must make.

Xiao Chen felt the emotional ups and downs of his lover, and somehow he suddenly had an idea to mess things up. 

Xiao Chen had an outstanding temperament, and was always the star of the crowd. Along the way, there were always teenage girls discreetly talking about him.

Xiao Chen pretended to inadvertently tug at the neckline of his clothes, and then opened the top two buttons with a frank expression, intending to see how his lover would react.

Before Jing Hezhi could speak, the girl who had been staring at him next to him became even more excited. At a distance of more than three meters, he could hear the other party’s excited expression, “He is so handsome, and the collarbone looks so good. Now, I really want to give him some hickies on his neck.”

Xiao Chen felt that something was about to go badly, judging by how easily jealous his lover gets, he would definitely not end well. He immediately buttoned up the buttons and covered his chest tightly. 

But unexpectedly, the girl continued to speak, “My God, did you see the boy in the white shirt is really sexy? I can see the blush on his chest!

“…”

“Ah. ”

As soon as the girl’s voice fell, Xiao Chen heard the man’s sneer. 

That’s it, he was practically screwed.

Xiao Chen felt a wave of cold air on his back, and the view in front of him darkened, something was about to turn bad.

His man turned into a human form and appeared behind Xiao Chen, but there was no one other than Xiao Chen who could see him.

Xiao Chen choked, almost trampled under his feet, and immediately received the man’s eye cue, and followed the man’s footsteps with an innocent look on his face, walking to a remote corner. 

As soon as they reached the corner, the man slammed Xiao Chen against the wall between his arms.

He shrank into the man’s arms and blinked innocently, revealing a pure smile.

The man sneered, and put his arms around Xiao Chen’s waist, his flexible hands directly pulling the shirt out of his pants.

Both hands also stretched in conveniently. 

Even his right leg squeezed between Xiao Chen’s legs mercilessly.

“…”

Xiao Chen’s face suddenly blushed.

This place is too dangerous. If someone passes by and only sees him, they would definitely think that he was doing something bad. 

The man bit Xiao Chen’s collarbone, as if venting his anger, kept biting out one hickey after another.

Realizing that the child still had energy to zone out, he took a deep bite.

Xiao Chen took a breath.

The man bit till his heart was content and looked at Xiao Chen’s body. The child whose face was flushed red, and even couldn’t help but make noises, filled up his vision. He squinted his eyes, leaned to the child’s ear, and blew at his ears. As expected, his ears, which were his sensitive points, turned into a tender pink color. 

The man smiled and opened his lips, “Go back and wait tonight.”

Just as he ended the sentence, Xiao Chen had a bad feeling about it later.

He even felt a little sore at his waist and his legs have become weak.

???? 

Sh*t

In contrast, the man smiled even brighter

No one knew what bad idea he came up with, probably something really dirty.

Li Qiaoyi rushed to the dormitory assigned to Ma Yangyu by the school, and was taken aback by the people at the door. 

A group of killers and gangsters surrounded the door, looking like a group of little bastards. They don’t look like students from the school at all, but when he thinks of Ma Yangyu’s red hairstyle, it really blends perfectly with the coloured heads of this group of people.

“Who are you?” “Li Qiaoyi walked in with a dazed expression.

Lu Yi Ang was sitting on Ma Yangyu’s bed holding a mobile phone and continuing to play the game, while the other people were playing their own games, so leisurely, and the owner of the room Ma Yangyu at this time was wrapped in a quilt, curled up in the corner, completely afraid to stick out his head. Even Li Qiaoyi stood at the door, and he could clearly feel Ma Yangyu’s body trembling.

Li Qiaoyi watched the scene before him, he felt like his head was about to explode, his hair was going to stand up, and an unknown anger burned on his chest. 

Lu Yi Ang looked up at him and said dismissively, “Little devil, we are here to help this guy. You don’t want to mix things up with adults. You don’t want to watch your classmate be tortured to death,right? ” After speaking, he continued to play with his mobile phone.

Li Qiaoyi’s face collapsed from the time he walked into this door. He glared at Lu Yi Ang, and didn’t speak, rushing directly to the corner Ma Yangyu was at, and knelt down on both legs, hugging Ma Yangyu in his arms.

The latter obviously trembled violently, and then struggled wildly, like a scourge.

Li Qiaoyi squeezed Ma Yangyu’s hand and hugged him tightly. Confined in his arms, he calmly reassured him, “It’s me! This is Li Qiaoyi. ” 

The person in his arms immediately stopped struggling, and Li Qiaoyi could feel the other party’s relief.

Li Qiaoyi’s heart tightened in an instant, and opened up a small corner of the other party’s quilt .

Revealing a pair of red and swollen eyes and a haggard face. He did not cry, but his whole face was numb, causing Li Qiaoyi to feel as if his heart was pierced by a needle.

He was completely taken aback, he could only hold Ma Yangyu tightly in his arms, as if he could transmit energy like this, his teeth were clenched tightly, and he said solemnly, “Don’t be afraid, starting from today, I will be with you every night. ” 

No one knew which of Ma Yangyu’s fragile nerves was triggered by this sentence. Ma Yangyu, who had been broken for too long, buried his head on Li Qiaoyi’s shoulder and sobbed silently. Tears suddenly soaked Li Qiaoyi’s clothes. Warm tears were directly rolling down Li Qiaoyi’s body.

Lu Yi Ang has always been using his peripheral vision to observe Ma Yangyu’s every move, seeing the two directly hugging each other, the movements are very intimate, and there is a rising nausea in his heart.

“Oh, guess what we have here. Two homosexuals.” Lu Yi Ang made a mocking sound without even trying to conceal it, and thunderous laughter broke out in the surroundings.

Li Qiaoyi clenched his hand and squeezed it into a fist. He glared at Lu Yi Ang, but did not refute, and just carried on, hugging Ma Yangyu tighter. 

Because now he cares more about the feelings of the person in his arms than he is arguing with those people. He patted Ma Yangyu on the back and kept comforting, “Don’t be afraid, I am here! ”

I must! I will protect you!

I swear!!





 “Ding Ling Ling.” It was the sound made by the Teru Teru Bozu outside the door as it was being blown by the breeze.

Ma Yangyu, who was shrunken under the quilt, immediately trembled when he heard this sound, and his body immediately stiffened. 

Li Qiaoyi gritted his teeth and hugged Ma Yangyu tightly in his arms, his head was sweating, and his heartbeat accelerated.

In the darkness, he opened his eyes, forcing himself to not close his eyes, beads of perspiration sliding directly down his forehead.

Li Qiaoyi leaned his head on Ma Yangyu and hugged him tightly, Ma Yangyu shrank into his arms like a ball of threads, and Li Qiaoyi was exactly like a guardian.

Lu YiAng and his party pasted all kinds of spells across the entire room, all of them looking defensive about what was to come. Even though they seemed like killers at first, at this moment, they were unexpectedly calm. 

The Teru Teru Bozu is still swaying non-stop, even if it is separated by a door, everyone in the room could hear the ringing sound clearly.

It’s like a lullaby, with no rhythm, but it has an ethereal feeling. It is very cold, like playing a scary nursery rhyme.

Lu YiAng’s ears moved and his expression was serious. His five senses were much more sensitive than ordinary people, and he could hear many details that others could not hear.

Darkness is scary not because of how terrifying it is, but because of people’s fear of the unknown.

“Tick. Tok.” It was the sound of dripping water that sounded every night, and at the same time, it was accompanied by a heavy fishy smell.

Lu YiAng frowned and looked at the people next to him.

The ghost was already here.

“Hahahahahahaha.” 

A woman’s laughter echoed through the air for no reason. The voice was trembling and very secretive. It rushed directly into the eardrum of the person from all sides of the wall, amplified bit by bit, and then turned into a man’s mad laughter. The laughter was repeated over and over again, and the laughter was frantic and scratching.

Ma Yangyu looked terribly in pain, curled up in Li Qiaoyi’s arms and began to sob. The cry was very soft, but it hit Li Qiaoyi hard and accurately.

Li Qiaoyi had bloodshot eyes. He can clearly feel his heartbeat accelerating, and he can also hear the sound of tensed Ma Yangyu’s heart beating.

The two of them hugged each other like conjoined twins. 

Li Qiaoyi made up his mind and pulled off Li Qiaoyi’s quilt. The latter was startled, and his legs flinched back.

But when Ma Yangyu saw that it was indeed Li Qiaoyi, he stopped, and his two rabbit looking eyes looked at Li Qiayoyi pitifully.

Li Qiaoyi’s heart throbbed, he put the quilt over his head, and got under, grabbing the back of the other’s head with both hands, forcing Ma Yangyu’s forehead to touch his forehead.

It was only two centimetres between the faces of the two of them and they could feel each other breathing while their warm breaths became entangled with each other. 

Li Qiaoyi clasped his fingers behind Ma Yangyu’s head, and Ma Yangyu choked a few times. Both hands directly hug the other’s waist, completely trusting the other’s presence.

Li Qiaoyi pulled out a smile, “Don’t be afraid.”

He will definitely not let that ghost hurt you!

The bloody smell spreading in the air is getting heavier and heavier, even a bit like the sour smell of a corpse that has rotted for several days. 

A man with yellow hair standing at the door was on alert, ready to take out his magic weapon for removing ghosts. Suddenly his pupils shrank suddenly, and a transparent rope fell from the ceiling. Without any preparation at all, the rope choked and strangled his neck.

The man’s body was strangled so that the soles of his feet were dragging away on the ground. He was terrified, his eyes widened, and he began to struggle frantically, and said vaguely, “Help me!”

The laughter from the wall became even louder and even brighter as if it was mocking them for being too arrogant.

The boy standing next to him immediately cut off the transparent rope holding Huang Mao with a knife. Huang Mao lost support, his legs softened, fell on his knees, and he kept coughing. 

The boy hurriedly helped him up.

It was also at this moment that the people in this line realized that they could not compare this incident with their usual missions to catch other little ghosts at all. After all, their level of cultivation was just barely sufficient. If they had known about the danger of this mission earlier, they wouldn’t have come at all.

There is no regret medicine in the world, and this disaster of grieving ghosts for debt collection will not just end there.

Lu YiAng swore secretly because he was too at a loss. 

He found that the barriers he had arranged in the room were actually useless to this ghost. Those spells were already his best skills, and in the end, they had no effect on the female ghost. On the contrary, it was peanuts to the ghost.

Indeed, after an ordinary ghost hurt someone, it will be tortured to a fateful ending, experiencing the pain of bones being drilled, and finally turning into a puddle of blood.

Therefore, in this situation, it will be much easier for a ghost eliminator to catch ghosts, as it was just a matter of moving your fingers.

The pink-haired girl realized that her body began to tremble. Suddenly, she spasmed, and it seemed that some viscous liquid had fallen on top of her head. It was chilly, and she subconsciously touched it with her hand. 

With the brightness of the moonlight, she could clearly see the colour of the liquid.

It was blood.

She widened her eyes, suddenly raised her head, and looked up.

A hideous grimace with a crooked smile, grinning openly the corners of his mouth, with a big mouth with blood and fangs. The face is full of folds and bloodstains, and what is even more frightening is that the scar on this face is still covered with a dense layer of insect eggs, which was uneven and definitely unfriendly to those with trypophobia. 

The girl opened her mouth wide, her eyes staring out of horror, the uvula in her mouth trembled and she let out a scream.

“Ahhhhh!!”

Hearing the screams and exclamations around him, Ma Yangyu’s body began to shake more severely, and even his breathing became a little more anxious.

The tip of Li Qiaoyi’s nose was touching the tip of Ma Yangyu’s nose, and he felt distressed looking at Ma Yangyu like this. 

He then put down his hands which were holding Ma Yangyu’s neck, grabbed Ma Yangyut’s ten fingers with his backhand, and clasped them in his palms.

Li Qiaoyi soon discovered that something was wrong. He found that he could clearly see through the quilt.

He could see a pair of blood-stained, bare-footed legs slowly approaching the two of them.

His heart tightened suddenly. 

At this moment, he suddenly thought of what the man said during the day.

Li Qiaoyi took a deep breath and looked at the person in his arms. Somehow he had the courage to lift the quilt and expose himself completely, Ma Yangyu hurriedly buried his head in Li Qiaoyi’s arms in fright.

The female ghost’s footsteps stopped in place.

The killers behind her rushed out through the door due to fear. Even Lu YiAng only hesitated for a moment before leaving Ma Yangyu behind. 

Li Qiaoyi stared at her boldly, and the ghost stood motionless. Finally, the ghost’s hideous face slowly returned to normal, and the bloody red clothes on her body returned to the original white, just like the way Li Qiaoyi first met her.

Just a little girl.

—

Xiao Chen stared at the indescribable pieces of cloth on the bed and pursed his lips. 

Jing Hezhi stood behind him and looked at him with a smile as if waiting for him to choose.

Open-seat pants, lace, see-through, tight-fitting, open-collar, corded…

Xiao Chen took a breath, thinking of the man’s phrase “Go back and wait” during the day, and he inevitably felt that he was finding his own death.

He turned around, grinning at the man, biting his teeth up and down, like a puppy exposing himself to the tiger. Not only was he not scary, but was also very cute. 

Jing Hezhi was amused, and he leaned forward, hugging Xiao Chen’s slender waist, taking advantage of his height, and directly propped his head on top of the child’s head, using his chin to play with the child’s hair, messing it up.

As if acting like a baby,

Xiao Chen turned around in the man’s arms and raised his head. The man’s grey eyes were looking straight at him, with a smile at the corner of his mouth.

Xiao Chen could clearly feel his heartbeat increase again, and his face started to burn slowly. After the two stared at each other for half a minute, Xiao Chen finally sighed. 

Mistake of beauty, it was indeed a mistake of beauty.

This is going overboard!

Xiao Chen closed his eyes and took a deep breath, as if he was determined, “This time only, not anymore.”

Jing Hezhi smiled but did not speak. 

In this aspect, once the strange switch in any man is turned on, it will be out of control, either zero times and countless times.

Furthermore, the man in front of him was a wolf with a big tail that had been holding back for thousands of years, and he watched Xiao Chen jump in front of his eyes for several years before finally waiting for him to reach adulthood.

He has never been satisfied in this aspect, and wouldn’t hate to have more and more.

Sigh, this can only be blamed on Xiao Chen for being too young. 

Jing Hezhi let go of the child and stood on the side with a smile, letting him continue to choose.

Xiao Chen hesitated again and finally reluctantly picked up the tights on the bed which had the most fabric…

The curvature of the man’s mouth rose even more obviously.

Sure enough, he was still too naive. 

—

Lu Yiming walked back to the room in a muddle-headed manner, his steps still a little erratic, his face looked upset as if he had been robbed of his wife.

The man who had been in the room obediently waiting for Lu Yiming to come back, reading the magazines and children’s story books Lu Yiming had prepared for him every day during the day, raised his head as soon as the door rang.

From the moment Lu Yiming entered the door, the man noticed that the other party’s emotions were very unstable. He immediately leaned forward, tilted his head, and followed Lu Yiming all the way from undressing and taking off his shoes to lying on the bed. 

“In a bad mood.” The man opened his mouth and asked directly.

Lu Yiming lay on the bed, looked at the ceiling, and asked sincerely, “Can people and ghosts live in harmony?”

The man looked at him a little strangely as if he didn’t understand why the other party suddenly felt emotional, but he still replied, “As a ghost eliminator, you still chose to hide me here, so shouldn’t you already know the answer to your question?”

Lu Yiming turned to look at him. 

The man lay down, facing Lu Yiming, looking at him.

Lu Yiming was silent.

Yes, from the day he decided to hide the man here, it was destined that he could not become a qualified ghost eliminator.

Furthermore, he didn’t know or offend any grieving ghosts from the beginning. 

Finally, Lu Yiming sighed and said, “I met the ghost king today.”

The man was startled and his pupils shrank suddenly.

“He is the same as described in the book, brutal, and possesses absolute strength.” Lu Yiming’s tone was very plain, so plain that people would doubt the authenticity of what he said.

He was just so vulnerable in front of him. 

“Similarly, just like the picture in the album, he is so in love with a man as if it was carved in his bones.”

His love is so great that no one else is allowed to look at that man.

After the conversation, Lu Yiming and the man looked at each other.

At this moment, the man’s eyes only reflected Lu Yiming’s face, listening to his speech seriously and couldn’t contain the joy his eyes 

Lu Yiming smiled unconcealed.

He finally understood why the ghost king did not allow others to look at that person.

Because whether it is a human or a ghost, they have seven emotions and six desires, and there will be people they love deeply.

Lu Yiming leaned forward, as if asking the other party’s opinion, but also appearing like he was just informing the other party, “I want to kiss you.” 

The man froze for a moment, not registering what he just heard and it seemed that he didn’t understand the other party’s meaning.

In the next second, his thin lips were directly pressed against his lips.

Love never stops. —- <<Bible>>

—


 “You like him” Chen Lulu, wearing a white dress, with her innocent eyes open, looked at the two people who were kneeling on the ground and hugging each other.

Li Qiaoyi guarded Ma Yangyu behind him, his eyes were guarded, and he pursed his lips after hearing the little girl’s words, and looked at the trembling boy behind him with the corner of his light, his heart aching indescribably. 

Ma Yangyu raised his head slightly and met Li Qiaoyi’s gaze.

“Yes.” Li Qiaoyi nodded firmly.

Now not only the female ghost nodded thoughtfully, but even Ma Yangyu, who was hiding behind him, opened his mouth wide in shock.

He buried his head in Li Qiaoyi’s back, with his face pressed against his clothes, he could feel the warmth of Li Qiaoyi’s body. 

Lifting his head slightly, he could feel the Li Qiaoyi’s firm presence protecting him,

To be honest, at this moment, it is fake that his heart is not moved.

The female ghost shook her head, and there was an awkward silence in the air.

Li Qiaoyi gritted his teeth, striking the iron while it was hot, and continued, “I know I am selfish, selfish enough to know that he did something wrong, and he is sorry for you, but I still hope you can let him go.”

The female ghost said nothing, glancing at Li Qiaoyi and then at Ma Yangyu.

At last.

The little girl took a step back as if she planned to stop it today.

Unexpectedly the silent Ma Yang Yu who was blushing the whole time, summoned all his courage, and stretched his head out from behind Li Qiaoyi, gasped, and said with his red eyes and hoarse voice, “Chen Lulu, I’m sorry.” 

“After you committed suicide, I withdrew the confession,” Ma Yangyu’s eyes were hollow, and his brain began to recall.

Li Qiaoyi was slightly surprised when he heard these words.

Ma Yangyu continued, “But I was a minor at the time, and I withdrew my confession several times. Therefore, as soon as the court opened, I was deprived of the right to be a witness, and my words had no legal effect.”

At this point, Ma Yangyu tried to put on a smile 

The female ghost stood still, watching him quietly, but her trembling shoulders could clearly feel that the other party’s emotions at this moment were not as peaceful as they seemed on the surface.

Not knowing what he was thinking, Ma Yangyu’s entire face screamed with pain, “I have been looking for Li Jianjun, and I have been working hard to find evidence for you, and because of that, my psychological condition has been deteriorating in the past few years. I took a break from school for several years before continuing to study. Later, after several tries, I learned that he changed his name and moved to continue teaching. That’s why I came here. I have been…”

At this point, Ma Yangyu choked.

“I have never forgotten you, I have never forgiven myself.” 

“I’m sorry, I’m very sorry”

The whole room was left with Ma Yangyu’s choking and sobbing alone, echoing in the empty room.

At that time, he was just a child with an unsound view of right and wrong. He was young and ignorant. He believed whatever others said. If Chen Lulu had not committed suicide by jumping off the building, he would have never realized that his actions were wrong!

Chen Lulu did not forgive him. 

Similarly, he can’t forgive himself!

For so many years, he has been trapped in the abyss of guilt and self-blame, unable to pull himself out.

For a long time, the three of them did not speak.

At last. 

The female ghost didn’t say anything, took a step back, and completely disappeared in front of the two of them.

It was completely silent.

She let Ma Yangyu off.

After the female ghost left, Li Qiaoyi put Ma Yangyu in his arms, listening to the person in his arms sobbing, and silently patting the other person on the back. 

“Don’t cry, I’m here.”

After the female ghost left, Ma Yangyu finally loosened his nerves from a tight state. His mentality was already fragile. He lay on Li Qiaoyi’s shoulder and cried loudly, his mouth kept repeating ‘I’m sorry.’

In this world, there are some mistakes that can never be made up for, even if it takes a lifetime or longer.

If the other party can forgive you, no matter what the reason is, it is a blessing in the world. 

—

Jing Hezhi silently opened his eyes in the dark, put his right hand around his sleeping baby, and stared at the other person’s sleeping face intently.

Suddenly, his eyes sharpened and he narrowed.

Just now, he suddenly felt Chen Lulu’s grievance disappear. 

When he saw the secret of heaven, he knew that when Chen Lulu’s grievances were completely let go, it meant that the story of this world had come to an end.

Once this story is over, the energy from this world that they need will be gathered.

Once gathered, it means…

The man’s grey eyes shrank. 

It means that Xiao Chen’s memory will be restored!

The man thought that his lover’s memory was about to be restored, his heartbeat was thunderous, and his heart was so sour that he was a little speechless.

When he was still Xu Sheng, until the end of his academic life, he didn’t see the so-called truth. He tossed and turned in the world, frantically searching for hundreds of years, but there was nothing left.

It wasn’t until that world also came to an end that he realized that this world was just a combination of groups of data, and his lover was only one part of this data and had already been sent into the new world. 

He changed his fate to become the god of death in the second world, but once again lost his memory, but it was also a blessing in disguise, as he discovered the so-called truth, and knew the way to escape.

In that world, he waited until the end of his lover’s life and immediately followed in his footsteps to the third world, repeating the reincarnation process.

It is a pity that Xiao Chen in every world is like a formatted tool man, who has lost the beautiful memories of what they have experienced together, and he is the only one who occasionally recalls the ups and downs of the past in his long life.

But the good thing is that, despite this, no matter what they have gone through, no matter what they have become with each other, they will still fall in love with each other without hesitation and continue to love each other. 

After all, there is nothing in this world happier than the person you love who loves you as well.

Jing Hezhi hugged Xiao Chen tighter, sniffing the body scent on his body.

The grey eyes were like a deep pool, too deep to see the obscure changes in his eyes.

Some memories were buried deep in his memory, while the memories within his reach began to surface in his mind. 

The huge house was hidden in the darkness. The walls outside the house were covered with ivy, and even the door of the house was covered densely. No one repaired it. Even its leaves and branches became very yellow. It looked like a haunted house, gloomy, without any vitality.

There is no light in the house, the screws of the bulbs are rusty, there are various spider webs on the walls, and the inside is very humid, and even a very unpleasant odour of corpses can be smelled, which is pungent and a bit irritating. Gagging.

“Senior, senior…” It was a man’s voice.

This voice was like a devil’s low groan, with a bit of hoarseness, echoing continuously in the air. 

But he shouted very affectionately and attentively like he was calling out to his own god.

The door of the bedroom was closed tightly, and a corpse that had turned into white bones was lying on the bed. The muscle and internal organs of the corpse had long turned into ashes by the washing of time. Even the white bones were already so fragile that you can fold them in half.

If you look closely, you can find that in the darkroom, apart from the bones, there seems to be something dark on the bed.

It looks a bit like a shadow at first glance but can see the outline when you look closely, and it can even become a three-dimensional black shadow. 

The limbs of the black shadow were like a snake tightly entwined with the white bones, and the white bones were almost merged with themselves, and the mouth was still muttering constantly, fascinated and intoxicated like it was crazy.

“Senior, where are you…”

“I can’t find you…”

“Are you abandoning me?” 

“I miss you so much…”

The man with a black robe stood quietly in front of the spirit tablet, the black robe covered half of his face, his eyes and nose were blocked, only a thin lip and lower jaw were exposed, making it hard to see his expression.

There are countless red roses on the spirit tablet in front of him, and a black-and-white photo is hanging beside him. The person in the photo is a very young-looking boy. Phoenix-shaped eyes and smiling openly, it was a very comforting look.

The man looked at the photo quietly, the corners of his mouth suddenly rose up, not knowing what he was thinking of. 

Finally, he took out a necklace similar to a sickle from his pocket.

What’s even more amazing is that this necklace immediately changed from the length of a little finger to the size of a human arm.

The fingers of the man’s other hand rubbed gently on this black and white photo, and the movements were very gentle, especially the position of the boy’s eyes in the photo, which was repeatedly rubbed by him several times. His movements were gentle as if they were touching his lover.

“Baby, don’t worry, I will come to you soon…” 

The man’s voice was very calm, completely monotonous, but inexplicably, this voice made people shudder.

In the next second, the man raised his sickle, and the cold light was directly reflected on the black and white photo, revealing a chill.

Finally, the man raised the sickle and inserted it into his heart without hesitation…

Blood flowed down his heart, soaking his black robe, and a fishy smell filled the air accompanying the light rose fragrance. 

Having lost his centre of gravity, he lay directly on the spirit tablet, sniffing the smell of the rose above, with a smile at the corner of his mouth, but his expression was uglier than when crying.

“Wait for me, I will come to you soon…”

“Baby…”

Xu Sheng, Reaper, Tan Jun, Su Yan, Yu Mo, Jing Hezhi… 

Xiao Chen’s eyelids trembled and he got a headache. He was about to split, feeling that he was about to explode, and suddenly his brain was stuffed into something.

There seemed to be countless pairs of grey eyes spinning in his mind, and the strong emotions made him unable to digest at all.

It was like several beasts were spinning around him constantly, trying to strip him alive, tear him apart and put his bones into his abdomen.

And as if he was drowning, he couldn’t breathe through his mouth and nose, and couldn’t breathe completely. 

It’s not right.

There is another person, he seems to have forgotten someone.

Xiao Chen frowned in pain and closed his eyes tightly.

A person who is extremely important to him. 

The man soon discovered that something was wrong with his child. Knowing that it was a sequel of memory recovery, he immediately hugged the person in his arms as if he were holding a baby, and began to soothe him and pat the other person on the back.

The grey eyes flashed with a stream of light, and the cold sweat on the child’s forehead was wiped with the sleeve.

So who did he forget?

Xiao Chen frowned and his heartbeat accelerated. 

His subconsciousness told him that this answer is very important.

In the next second, the tips of his ears moved, as if he heard someone put their lips to his side neck and talk, and the warm snort hit his neck, making it itchy.

“I am a poisonous snake in the deep ditch. I can’t see the light. I deserve to be spurned and disgusted.”

“But for some reason, I fell in love with you, who is even more dazzling than roses.” 

“But I only learned later that you were actually an abandoned rose.”

“So I want to drag you into the abyss and sink in with me.”

“In the end.”

“It was you who saved me from the darkness.” 

Who is this?

Who said those words?

The sound was familiar.

Xiao Chen had a moment of revelation, as if thinking of something, his brain was clear, and something came directly into his mind. 

Jing Hezhi looked at the vision outside the window, lightning and thunderstorm.

The loud rumbling sound resounded throughout.

Xiao Chen finally opened his eyes.

He looked up and met a pair of grey eyes. 

The man clenched his hand, clasped his fingers, and smiled, “Baby, are you ready to escape this world with me?”



Arc 6 Bixian

 The icy wind made Xiao Chen’s ankles feel a bit cold.

The crescent moon hung in the sky, there were no stars, and it was deserted. 

The alleys are very long and there are no street lights. On this kind of cold night, it is even more frustrating, you can’t see the road ahead at all, and you will start shivering without even knowing where the wind is coming from.

Xiao Chen could even hear the barking of dogs not far away.

He was not sure if it was an illusion, but he always felt that something was following him.

Xiao Chen stood still many times, looking back, holding the phone in his hand as a torchlight, he gulped, and a thin layer of cold sweat rolled down his temples. 

Maybe I’m just overthinking.

He comforted himself.

“Crack.” A sound.

Xiao Chen’s body trembled and was taken aback. He held the phone and pointed at the source of the sound, pretending to be strong and yelled, “Who? Who’s there?”

No one answered.

Xiao Chen was cursing silently in his heart, knowing that he shouldn’t have taken this dark path just to take a shortcut.

He took a deep breath, accelerated his pace, and began to walk forward as if he was hypnotised, swearing to never look back.

However, as soon as he took two steps, he heard the sound of footsteps coming from behind him, which even blended perfectly with his own. 

There was also a strange sound coming from behind, something similar to the sound made by metal rubbing against the wall. He didn’t know if it’s because of watching too many horror movies, but he felt that this rubbing sound is like a knife scratching the wall.

After Xiao Chen heard the sound, he paused subconsciously. What’s even weirder was that the moment he stopped, the sound of footsteps also stopped.

Xiao Chen started to stiffen instantly, and quickly walked away, immediately, the sound of footsteps behind him also continued.

Xiao Chen’s footsteps accelerated, and the sound of footsteps behind him was the same as his, adapting to the frequency of his walking, and speeding up together with his steps. 

Cold sweat slid down from his forehead, he gulped, without thinking through his brain, completely out of physical instinct, he ran like crazy, as if he was running the 100-meter sprint. Just like there was a scourge behind him, and if he doesn’t run fast enough, he will be eaten.

What’s more terrifying is that at this moment, Xiao Chen’s cell phone rang very unexpectedly. Suddenly the cell phone rang in the empty alley, with a mysterious feeling.

Xiao Chen wanted to curse even more. Before he could see which annoying person it was, he cut off the phone and rushed forward desperately.

The man behind also ran after him. 

Xiao Chen could even hear the sound approaching step by step.

Fuck!

Fuck!

Xiao Chen, like a crazy person, thought he was going to see his ancestors because he was going to die. In just one minute, he even thought of the hot headlines in the local newspapers tomorrow. 

“A college boy was murdered on his way back to school, and his body was thrown on the street.”

Thankfully the alley wasn’t too long, and Xiao Chen quickly ran to the exit without making a few turns.

Just as he stepped out of the alley, the footsteps behind him stopped too, followed by the sound of something cracking.

Xiao Chen didn’t dare to think too much, the only thought in his mind was to leave this scary place. 

And when he walked out of this alley and rushed into a crowded place, his first thought was to vow that he would never choose to go to this kind of ghostly place where there is not a single person in the middle of the night, just because he was in a hurry..

Xiao Chen breathed slowly, making sure that there was no danger around, then picked up his phone and checked the call log.

Damn, which idiot was calling him.

Looking at the name on the screen, Xiao Chen couldn’t help but roll his eyes. 

Sure enough, it was the idiot in his dormitory.

Darkness is boundless, and danger always lurks in the invisible depths.

It felt like there was something terrible that was swallowing human blood, and then the air began to be filled with a strong smell of blood.

The black shadow released his hand, and the sturdy man fell directly to the ground with a bang along with the knife in his hand. 

The black shadow didn’t care about the man on the ground, staring tightly in the direction of the exit.

No one knew what he was thinking of, but then he sneered.

“Hey, did you hear that a corpse was found on the Liquan Road not far from our school this morning!”

“Ah? No! Don’t our school often have students walking that path back to school at night? Was it a student from our school!” 

“No, no! How could it be! A middle-aged man!”

“Ah! My goodness! That’s terrible!”

Xiao Chen pricked his ears and listened to the conversation of the person next to him. When he heard that he was on Liquan Road, his face instantly paled, and his eyes were a little hollow.

His roommate Zheng Hui just bought a few bottles of water from the convenience store and walked back, and put it on Xiao Chen’s table, scared Xiao Chen suddenly stood up from the table, and the bang made the tables and chairs very loud. Everyone looked over with a dazed expression. 

Zheng Hui was the most frightened. He didn’t expect Xiao Chen to have such a big reaction. He bounced and stood up, almost hitting his head, causing him to take a step back and sit down. At least he didn’t fell onto the ground.

“…”

“…”

Xiao Chen came back to his senses and sat back in his seat a little embarrassed, the surrounding people then went back to doing their own things. 

But despite this, Xiao Chen’s face was still very upset.

Zheng Hui could tell at a glance that he had something on his mind, so he poked his arm with an elbow, and moved his head close, “What’s wrong, big brother, why do you look so disoriented? Did you see a ghost? Hahaha.”

Zheng Hui didn’t mean anything else, he just wanted to tease Xiao Chen, so that he will be more relaxed. He didn’t expect that as soon as his voice fell, Xiao Chen looked even worse and Zheng Hui realized there was something wrong and frowned, “What’s the matter?”

Before Xiao Chen could answer, the group of gossip girls next to him had continued to trumpet the deadly incident. 

“I heard it was a knife, and it was left at the scene?”

“No, I heard that he was sucked dry!”

“Chey, whatever! Anyway, no one would dare to go to Liquan road in the future. ”

As Zheng Hui listened to the conversation, he slowly then realised what was happening. He immediately widened his eyes, opened his mouth, and grabbed Xiao Chen’s arm with both hands, and said in horror, “Didn’t you tell me that you were walking through Liquan road yesterday? And I even laughed at you last night, for being such a scaredy-cat!” 

Xiao Chen grinned reluctantly, but this laugh looked more ugly than crying, and he replied sheepishly, “Yes, that’s right.”

Zheng Hui was silent for an instant, not daring to say another word.

No wonder Xiao Chen was so scared just now, if it was him, he would also be scared to death.

Fortunately, nothing happened. 

Zheng Hui pat Xiao Chen’s back with his hands, and comforted, “It’s okay, it’s all over, don’t think too much.”

As soon as he finished saying the sentence, Zheng Hui felt chills, causing him to tremble all over, and his hands fell from Xiao Chen’s body and touched the back of his own neck.

The chill is like someone holding a knife against the back of his head.

Strangely, as soon as he put his hand down, the biting chill disappeared without a trace. 

However, Zheng Hui didn’t take this episode to heart.

“Hey, brothers, do you want to play the Bunshinsaba!”

“Ha”

“Haven’t you all heard of it, it is just asking ghosts to help you by answering your doubts?” 

“Haha, how can there be ghosts in this world? Anyways I’m bored so count me in.”

“Me too! Me too!”

In just a moment, all the guys in room 404 were playing the game, except for Xiao Chen who was still lost in his own thoughts and Zheng Hui who accompanied him.

Xiao Chen sighed, glanced at the crowd, stood up, and climbed up on his bed with a heavy heart. His bed was on the upper bunk with a curtain. After pulling the curtain, he lay on the bed and continued to think about it. He was the only one who put the curtain on the bed, and people laughed at him for being so feminine when school first started. 

Zheng Hui glanced at Xiao Chen who was already in bed, maybe out of boredom, he also joined the Bunshinsaba circle. He didn’t plan to play, he just wanted to see how they planned to do it.

The boys turned off the lights and placed the candles in a circle. They were sitting in the middle of the candles. A pen and a notebook were placed on the ground.

It was Zhou Keyu who first suggested playing Bunshisaba, the eldest brother in the dormitory. He basically organized all the good activities, so this time is no exception.

He seemed to have checked a lot of Bunshinsaba information, and looked very skilful, and quickly commanded, “Yes, right, right, let’s hold this pen at the same time, set it up, I will tell you the chant and we will repeat it together later. Got it?” 

Everyone said that they understood, Zhou Keyu nodded in satisfaction, and said, “The chant is Bunshinsaba, Bunshinsaba, I’m your previous life, you’re my past life. If you hear this call, draw a circle on the paper”

Maybe the atmosphere is a bit scary, but everyone’s face was half in the shade and half-lit up by the candlelight. It was so terrifying that the timidest Wang Jiahao in the dormitory wanted to stop playing.

Suddenly he spoke up in the extremely tense atmosphere, and said embarrassedly, “Well, I don’t want to play anymore, can I leave?”

Zhou Keyu was immediately upset, and yelled, “If you are such a coward, why did you even join in the first place? Since we already started, there’s no more backing out, are you even still a man?” 

No one dared to speak anymore, even if there were still people who wanted not to play, they didn’t dare to speak.

“Hu”

Everyone took a deep breath.

Their heartbeats accelerated, and the surroundings were terribly silent. 

Xiao Chen lay on the bed, opened his eyes, rolled over, unable to sleep.

His whole brain was occupied by what the girls said in the day. The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became.

He didn’t know if it was because it being the beginning of autumn, he even felt a little cold on the soles of his feet.

The chill first hit the soles of his feet, then spread on his calves, and then slowly moved up… 

Xiao Chen shivered as if his body was being touched by something cold.

He sat up, hurriedly covering his body with the quilt, and then lay back, but his movements were very light, and he did not disturb the group of people playing Bunshinsaba under the bed.

He leaned sideways again, facing the wall and stared attentively.

The light from the streetlamp outside the window shone in, hit Xiao Chen’s bed, and reflected on the wall. On the wall, there was an outline of Xiao Chen’s shadow. 

Xiao Chen stared at his shadow without blinking, and after a while, tiredness slowly climbed on top of his head, and he closed his eyes.

He fell asleep.

After he closed his eyes, Xiao Chen’s shadow on the wall moved without warning, and then he sat up.

Looking at it again, it turned out that Xiao Chen’s shadow was still quietly reflected on the wall, nothing unusual. 

But two shadows split out of thin air on the wall!!

The split shadow was obviously bigger and stronger than Xiao Chen’s shadow, and even the silhouette of the side face reflected was somewhat different.

The shadow rolled his head, the corners of his mouth moved, as if he was smiling, he tilted his head again, and looked at where Xiao Chen was lying.

The outline of the corners of the mouth twitched even more exaggeratedly. 

Hehe, it smells so good.

No one knew how long it sat there and watched him. Finally, the shadow lay back quietly again, slowly…

Melting into Xiao Chen’s shadow again.

At the same time, the boys stared with excitement. 

All of them stared at the thin paper on the ground, and the four people held pens in their hands at the same time.

For some reason, there was obviously no wind in the room, but the candlelight lit by the candle was swaying from side to side.

Under the shining of the candlelight, the figures of the four people, one by one, all hit the surface of the paper, and they were perfectly crossed together.

Finally, under the eyes of the boys. 

The pen!

Moved!!

— 



 The pen quivered very slightly, and if everyone were not paying attention, they would not have noticed this subtle change at all.

The candlelight continued to flash, and their figures were reflected on the wall. Due to the angle, the shadows on the wall became a little distorted. 

Yuan Daqiang, who could not control his temper, waited for a long time. He couldn’t help but start asking questions first, “Bunshinsaba Bunshinsaba, can I chase Li Yewen?”

Li Yewen is his goddess, something that everyone knows.

The tip of the pen moves slowly like an ant crawling.

Yuan Daqiang swallowed a mouthful of saliva, followed by movement of his Adam’s apple. It was obvious that he was very nervous at this moment, even cold sweat was rolling down his face. 

Everyone stared at this pen intently, unable to tell whether it was more fear or more excitement.

The pen moves very slowly, twists and turns, and the drawing looks like an earthworm, without any artistic sense

Zhang Hui sat next to him, hugged the fence beside the bed, swallowed, and he was very nervous.

Finally, the pen moved slowly on the paper for a long time, and finally settled down.

Everyone took a closer look.

When everyone saw it clearly, Yuan Daqiang’s face also darkened.

It was a big twisted cross on the paper in this chapter.

F*ck 

Doesn’t that mean impossible?

Everyone’s eyes turned left and right, but no one dared to make a sound. They held their breath, for fear that they might offend some gods and eventually cause trouble to the upper body.

They exchanged glances, shaking their heads from time to time, as if deciding who to ask next, and gestured to each other.

At the beginning, Zhou Keyu, who proposed to play Bunshinsaba, had a strange expression. He lowered his head and remained silent. 

Finally, someone noticed that he was acting weirdly and glanced at him.

For a while, everyone’s eyes fell on Zhou Keyu.

Zhou Keyu lowered his head and raised it suddenly under the bewildered eyes of everyone, which shocked everyone.

He was like a robot, moving his neck violently, making a crackling sound. 

The room was very quiet, amplifying the abrupt creaking sound countless times and piercing through people’s ears.

In the next second, Zhou Keyu suddenly showed a weird smile. Before everyone realised what happened, he opened his mouth to the maximum, exposing his gums, and his tongue shook violently in his mouth.

Everyone looked at him in horror as if he was crazy, everyone froze in place as if they forgot to escape.

Immediately afterwards, Zhou Keyu’s eyeballs moved up and down, and he had crossed eyes, with an extremely ugly expression. 

The boys who had been short-circuited for a long time were completely panicked. At that moment, everyone’s brain waves were connected together.

Damn, is Zhou Keyu possessed by a ghost?

Just as everyone was about to pull away and run away, Zhou Keyu, who showed a strange expression, suddenly closed his mouth.

Zhang Hui sat motionless next to him, like a sculpture. He dared not breathe, his pupils shrank severely. 

Seeing everyone’s unpredictable expressions,

Zhou Keyu did not hold back, laughed out loud, let go of his pen holding hand, and laughed out loud, “You fools actually believe that Bunshinsaba exist in this world, that is so ridiculous, your expressions just now were damn exciting, hahahaha. ”

The air has frozen for three full seconds, and everyone realizes that they have been tricked by the bastard Zhou Keyu, so they let go of the pen and directly turned on the light in the dormitory.

“scared to death!” 

“Zhou Keyu, you’re itching for a beating, aren’t you? You dare to make this kind of joke, believe it or not, I’m whipping you!!”

They looked around at each other and turned around to beat Zhou Keyu. Especially Yuan Daqiang, the only one who asked a question, his face really cooled down at a speed visible to the naked eye just now, and he looked desperate. Now that he knows the truth, even if he broke Zhou Keyu’s leg, it wouldn’t compensate for his feelings just now.

“F*ck, Zhou Keyu, you bastard, wasting my feelings!”

Zhang Hui, who was half-frightened, took a sigh of relief, bent his back straight, and patted his chest. 

Damn, he almost got scared to death just now!

For a while, everyone’s attention was on beating Zhou Keyu.

But what they didn’t know was that the pen that was thrown on the ground by them casually, and then rolled under the bed, moved slightly in a corner they didn’t see.

The black ballpoint pen stood up without any support, moved on the floor without any signs, and seemed to be writing, but the strange thing was that the words written were not black, but scarlet. 

It just stood firm, moved half a centimeter and fell back to the ground with a snap, as if it was interrupted abruptly.

Together with the candlelight in the room that hadn’t been extinguished, it shook more severely.

In the darkness, something terrible seemed to be awakened. He opened his mouth, stood up, and looked at the position of the pen.

“Heh.” 

A sneer.

In a corner that no one found, a huge black shadow pinched a very small hand with another one.

The smaller one was caught before he could escape, and it struggled frantically, making a roar that humans could not hear.

But his strength in front of this dark shadow was mere peanuts compared to it, and he was vulnerable. 

The big one opened its mouth, swallowed it in one bite, and chewed twice.

“Burp.” The black shadow made a saturated hiccup.

The world is finally quiet!

He slowly crawled back to the bed and lay down beside the youth. 

Continue to stare at the good-looking young man in front of him.

The pen on the ground cracked.

It became two halves.

Midnight. 

The whole dormitory building has been sleeping, turning off the lights, and sleeping.

In 404’s dormitory, someone made a very uncomfortable sound.

Snoring, grinding teeth…

Xiao Chen’s sleep is relatively shallow, and he is very disturbed by these strange sounds every night. 

He frowned, his eyelids moved as if he was about to be awakened.

The black shadow on the wall seemed to have noticed this, and crawled down the wall slowly, seeming to be looking for the source of this noisy sound.

One minute later, it crawled back again.

A piece of peace. 

There is no more noisy sound.

Xiao Chen’s brows finally relaxed, and he continued to sleep peacefully.

Black Shadow was extremely satisfied, and followed the soles of Xiao Chen’s feet, wrapped around the opponent’s limbs, and kept rubbing against the opponent’s body.

Xiao Chen didn’t have the habit of wearing pants at night, so he basically only wore a big T-shirt, a pair of underwear, and a slender straight leg under the quilt. 

The black shadow can feel the smoothness of the skin.

It feels very comfortable.

He wanted it.

And Xiao Chen, who was asleep, didn’t know anything about it. 

At night, it is its own carnival.

Xiao Chen woke up at dawn and felt that he finally had a good night’s sleep, as he was not woken up by the sound in the dormitory at midnight.

He patted his forehead with his wrist and frowned.

Why did he feel sore everywhere on your body? 

It was like something was pressing on him the entire night.

Especially the neck, it seems to have a stiff neck.

However, Xiao Chen’s sleeping posture has always been very good. Generally speaking, when he sleeps, he will still be in the same posture when he wakes up the next day. But what happened today was rarely the case.

However, after sleeping, his anxiousness from yesterday subsided, and the depression that was pressing on his chest also faded. 

Xiao Chen lay on his bed and flipped twice, stretching his waist left and right, folded the quilt, and got out of the bed.

The other five in the dormitory all slept like a dead pig, and were still awake.

Today is the weekend.

As soon as Xiao Chen put on his shoes, he saw Yuan Daqiang’s “tragic situation.” 

Yuan Daqiang’s face had turned blue and purple. He doesn’t know who put the tape on his mouth. His cheeks were taped together, such that it was deformed

All in all, breathing is difficult, and he could barely do so

What’s even stranger is that it was so uncomfortable to be stuck, but Yuan Daqiang didn’t reach out his hand to tear off the adhesive tape on his face. He was sleeping in a very rigid posture. Putting his hands and feet under the quilt stiffly.

All this fell into Xiao Chen’s eyes, it was simply incredible. 

No wonder he slept well yesterday!

However, Xiao Chen didn’t take it too seriously, put on his coat, picked up the toiletries, and walked out of the bedroom door, planning to wash up in the toilet at the end of the corridor.

As soon as Xiao Chen closed the door, the dark shadow that had been lurking for a long time immediately followed.

Xiao Chen patted his face with cold water, looked at himself in the mirror, casually scratched his hair with wet fingers, and simply styled his hair. 

Suddenly a sensation of pee came.

Xiao Chen paused, and put the washing tools on the washing table casually.

Xiao Chen pulled down his zipper and took out the things.

After a while, there was a rustling sound of water. 

The black shadow was lying on the ceiling, staring at the scene below quietly.

Whee.

It may be that he got up early today and there is no one else in the toilet.

Xiao Chen was thinking so. 

There was a sound of footsteps outside the door, and someone hummed a small song and was about to walk in.

The structure of male toilets is not like that of girls. Their urinals are arranged in rows without any partitions. Basically, the toilets are opened

Those without discipline, would even just compare sizes directly

“Boom!” There was a loud noise. 

Xiao Chen was taken aback for a moment, and pulled the zipper back.

It seemed that the man at the door fell for no reason, and seemed to have fallen quite tragically. The man was still cursing after he got up.

Xiao Chen washed his hands, picked up the washing tools and walked out, just passing by the person outside the door.

Xiao Chen didn’t care. 

The boy who came in was very tall, and Xiao Chen was also 1.8 meters tall, but the difference in height between the two was extremely obvious. The boy’s muscles were especially toned, which made Xiao Chen a little petite.

The boy just glanced at him from the side, they did not speak nor acknowledge each other, the two were in peace.

Xiao Chen’s lifestyle is very healthy. He will go to bed and get up when he needs to. He will get up early to run two laps in the school park before going to have breakfast.

Even if there is morning class, he does it every day. 

Xiao Chen, who had run for almost three kilometres, took the mineral water bought from the canteen and drank it.

Because of the exercise, his face flushed, and the tip of his ears, the back of his neck, and his entire head were already burning.

The sweat directly soaked his entire coat and even his underwear.

The whole body is sticky, and his skin was sticking to the clothes, which is very uncomfortable. 

Xiao Chen raised his head and outlined a beautiful arc, his Adam’s apple sliding up and down with the speed of the water, which was extremely sexy.

Back and forth on the road, many young girls had already seen him, and they looked excited and chatted with the people next to him.

Ah.

mine. 

Xiao Chen bought breakfast outside the school, and as soon as he stepped into the door of the dormitory apartment, he faintly noticed something was wrong.

Especially when he just walked to the first floor, he noticed that many students came out of the dormitory and gathered in the corridor near the stairs, and it was obvious that more and more people were onlookers.

At this point in time, it shouldn’t be.

Xiao Chen walked up the stairs suspiciously and found that it was not only the first floor but also the second floor. After the third floor, it was the fourth floor. 

But this time, the entrance to the fourth floor was cordoned off. The hostel Auntie stayed there to prevent people from entering. A group of curious passersby were looking over trying to see what was going on. Even the fifth and sixth floors came down to join in the fun.

Xiao Chen was puzzled. He stretched out his hand and pulled someone at random, and asked, “What’s wrong, why are you guys around here?”

The boy he grabbed happened to be a busybody, who didn’t know anything about learning but knew everything about the gossips in school.

The boy pulled the corner of Xiao Chen’s clothes and whispered, “It is said that a person died in the toilet on the fourth floor!” 

Xiao Chen’s eyes widened, like falling into an ice cellar as if someone had slammed him with a bucket of cold water.

The boy continued, “I heard that he was a player on the school basketball team, he was said to be 1.9 meters tall, and I don’t know the cause of death.”



“Did they find the cause of death?” Zhang Hui was still a little scared, and turned his gaze at the dormitory’s know-it-all Zhou Keyu.

Since a person died on the fourth floor, the washroom door had been cordoned off. Even if it wasn’t sealed, they would not have the courage to enter. 

Zhou Keyu wasn’t a superstitious person. He nibbled an apple while playing with the mobile phone. Shaking his legs, he indifferently stated, “Reportedly, it was a sudden death.”

“Sudden death? He was in perfectly good condition, how could it be a sudden death?” Zhang Hui was somewhat suspicious, he slumped his body on the bed and stretched his head out.

“I don’t know, that’s what everyone said. It seems that he saw something horrible before he died, or was stimulated by something, and then suddenly suffered a myocardial infarction, and in the end died suddenly.” Zhou Keyu took another bite of the apple.

“So it’s not homicide or suicide?” The person next to him proceeded to ask. 

“Anyway, the police have tentatively determined that it was an accidental death.”

Xiao Chen sat on a chair with a dazed face, listening to the conversations of others in the dorm.

Nobody knew.

He was, for the most part, the last person the deceased saw before he died.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen’s head roared.

Hearing it was a sudden death, his mood improved a tiny bit, but his mood still remained extremely low.

Zhang Hui thought that he had not recovered from the fright after the calamity that happened yesterday night, and without asking, thought that it would be better for Xiao Chen to be alone in the quiet.

“Hey, brothers, don’t you want to be in a relationship?” Chen Liu, a diaosi who had been laying in bed and playing with his mobile phone, sat up and shouted excitedly. 

His face was also flushed, as if he was stirred up.

The group of people, originally still chatting about gossip, immediately were attracted by his words. Their eyes lit up, shining just like an owl’s at night.

After all, male dorm 404, six men, six singles, and even more than half of them have been single since birth, how could they not be stirred up hearing this kind of news?

“Liu-zi, what do you mean, hurry up and say it clearly.” Zhou Keyu reacted the fastest, suddenly getting up and pouncing on it. 

Chen Liu lowly laughed twice, raised his eyebrows, and said with a smile, “I got to know a female junior in our school. Their dorms are all single dogs. I looked at their photos and they all looked pretty good.”

“Wow.” The group of single men instantly exclaimed.

“Fuck, what else is there to ask! Hurry, quickly!”

“Schedule, schedule! Hurry and schedule!” 

Chen Liu giggled twice, immediately picked up the phone and tapped the screen.

At once, everyone clapped their hands to express their excitement.

Yuan Daqiang had someone in his heart, and hesitated.

When Chen Liu saw this traitor, he laughed twice and elbowed Yuan Daqiang. The entire dorm could hear his voice saying, “He, I heard that Li Yewen is also in this dorm!” 

Yuan Daqiang’s eyes widened, “Fuck, you didn’t say that earlier! Damn!”

Chen Liu laughed more obviously, and Yang Sheng loudly added, “By the way! The time is tonight! Just at the William Castle not far from the school, let’s party!”

When the boys heard it, they stared left and right and saw each other’s oily heads, stubble and big underpants.

After dragging their feet, they each suddenly began to dress up. 

Especially Yuan Daqiang, who actually went to another dorm to borrow any perfume.

Xiao Chen was not in a good mood. He sat alone on a desktop, depressed, tapping his finger on the table again and again.

Chen Liu went up with a cheerful expression, and laughingly said, “Xiao Chen, don’t mourn, brother will take you to see beauties. I guarantee your good mood!”

Xiao Chen wanted to shake his head and suddenly realized that if he didn’t go, this group of people would undoubtedly not return in the evening, and he would be left all by himself in the dormitory. 

He paused, and paused, hesitating again and again, then finally nodded, “That’s alright.”

Shadow’s emotions began to be a little gloomy.

The dormitory lamp shone on the corner of the table, and the shadow finally fell on Xiao Chen’s lap. The shadow took the opportunity to hook onto Xiao Chen’s ankle.

Just as Chen Liu laid back on the bed, he felt an indescribable burst of cold in his heart, like he was wrapped in something dark and eerie. It began to spread through his whole body from the soles of his feet, making him inexplicably tremble. 

“Damn, why is it so cold today, the weather forecast definitely said the temperature is quite high!” Chen Liu couldn’t endure it and right away cursed in a low voice.

Keke.

Ah.

Nightfall. 

The crescent moon hung up on the quiet and lonely sky.

Music, good food, beer, card games;

Six men and six women.

Compared with everyone who have already started to have fun, Xiao Chen was much quieter. 

He didn’t sing, didn’t drink, and didn’t even take a few bites of the snacks, he just sat quietly in his seat. That alone gave off the feeling of an ineffable temperament, untouched by worldly matters, which was very eye-catching.

Especially with the swaying coloured lights shining on him, indistinctly bright, his outline was completely solid, and hisfacial features were delicate.

Zhou Yanyao, who had been watching him from the side for a long time, couldn’t hold back. She had no resistance to this kind of male appearance, all her previous boyfriends were of this type. 

Zhou Yanyao looked neat and tidy, appeared to be completely pretty and innocent, and smiled even more sweetly. Very few boys could refuse this one.

Zhou Yanyao has always been very direct when it came to her feelings, and she directly walked over to sit beside Xiao Chen.

“Hello, I’m Zhou Yanyao.” The girl tucked stray hair behind her ears, revealing a sweet smile.

Xiao Chen came back to himself, glanced at her, said nothing, and nodded, indicating that he knew. 

The shadow hid in a dark corner and gave a dark and sinister sneer.

Keke.

The girl was a little embarrassed to see that the other party didn’t want to pay attention to her interest.

Just as wanted to say something to ease the atmosphere, Zhou Keyu next to him suddenly raised his voice, “Hey everyone, let’s play Bixian.”

A few brothers from dorm 404 rolled their eyes, especially Yuan Daqiang, who was somewhat angry that he mentioned this and didn’t want to pay attention to him at all.

Before they could veto it, the girls beside them became a little excited.

Yuan Daiqiang’s goddess Li Yewen answered directly, “Okay.” 

Okay, this time they can’t not play now.

Xiao Chen pursed his lips, not knowing what was in his mind, and broke out in cold sweat.

He pulled out a strained smile and said, “No thanks, you play, I’ll just watch.”

The shadow hugged Xiao Chen in his arms, rubbed his hair, and felt the other’s body temperature. 

In the dim environment, he was even able to see the fine hair on the other’s skin crystal clear.

Ah, really good looking.

No one forced him, because the girl was unfamiliar, and just because they understood the boy’s character.

The remaining few became restless. 

Xiao Chen’s brain started to slacken again, not knowing what he was thinking, and sinking into layer upon layer of memories.

“Gu Luming, stay away from me.” Xiao Chen walked forward with his head down, listening to the sound of footsteps closely following along with his own, and could not help turning back, shouting towards the person who followed him.

The latter showed a bright smile, his mouth wide and his footsteps light.

He did not feel the slightest bit unhappy because of the other party’s refusal. He was even secretly delighted because the other party shouted his name. You could almost use the words “delusional” to describe him.

Xiao Chen was a little frustrated, and had to continue walking forward, the person behind him continued to closely follow his footsteps.

After a while, Xiao Chen stopped again. He gritted his teeth, furious and exasperated, and said, “I’m saying it for the last time, you really must not follow me, you stay far away from me.”

Gu Luming stood at the same place, even if Xiao Chen showed his anger and said something unpleasant, as long as Xiao Chen looked at him for a moment, he absolutely would show a big smile.

Xiao Chen wrinkled his nose, the rims of his eyes red. He directly crouched on the ground and started to cry, falling apart and saying, “You don’t want to die!”

Xiao Chen’s life was very hard, particularly for the people around him. It seemed that as long as they were a little close to him and treated him a bit better, they would die.

His mom and dad, friends, even little cats and dogs were all killed by him.

His isolation was never due to his character, but his own protective shell.

He was afraid of hurting the people he loved, so he was willing to stay away.

Gu Luming walked to Xiao Chen’s side, his heart aching. He crouched down and tilted his head to look at Xiao Chen’s expression, grey eyes exposed. Under the sun, they seemed to be shining, sparkling like gems.

He stretched out his hand to grab Xiao Chen’s hand, but was fiercely thrown off by the other party. He was not discouraged. He repeatedly held it, went back and forth several times, and finally Xiao Chen gave up the struggle and let the other party hold his hand.

Gu Luming squinted, his eyes could not hide his satisfaction and greed. The corner of his mouth ticked up, and he said in a deep voice, “I am not afraid.”

Compared to death, he was more afraid that he could not be with Xiao Chen.

This person is his light.

Xiao Chen choked, almost speechless, he took two breaths, and his soft voice finally spoke, “But I’m afraid.”

Gu Luming was the best person and treated him the best for so long, he absolutely couldn’t let him die.

Xiao Chen’s voice was so small, so small that it seemed that a mosquito was buzzing, but Gu Luming’s whole body’s attention was on Xiao Chen, how could he not hear clearly.

Gu Luming’s eyes lit up, as if he heard something inconceivable. He opened his mouth, closed it again, seeming to be a little speechless and stuttered.

He hesitated for a good moment.

He could only move closer, stiffly grabbing Xiao Chen’s body and holding him in his embrace, somewhat stuttering and bashfully saying, “I will not die, I will always protect you.”

Even if I die, I will protect you.

Xiao Chen paused, and then cried more ferociously, tears flowed down like they were free.

Then he paused, tentatively put his hands behind and embraced the other’s waist, buried his head in the other’s arms, and cried louder.

The boy’s grey eyes gleamed, a strange light flashed in his eyes, his expression was a nightmare he could not hide.

I’m so happy that you can’t bear to part with me.

I’m yours.

Xiao Chen withdrew himself from his memories.

The person next to him had long since pulled out a lot of candles from the small corner of the room, placed them on the floor, and lit them on fire.

Zhou Keyu turned off the music, turned off the lights, and the surroundings darkened instantly. 

The crowd sat directly on the floor and formed a circle.

The candlelight swayed from side to side, up and down, shadows hitting the ceiling and becoming somewhat distorted.

Unknowing of where it came from, wind blew up everyone’s hair and clothes, making them shiver.

Although the girls said that they were curious, they always had less courage in matters of the supernatural. When they lit the candles, they held each other and cowered, but their expressions were very excited, which could be regarded as very contradictory. 

Zhou Keyu suddenly showed a wicked smile, in a mood to assist, and jokingly said, “It’s better to do it like this, pairs of two, one man and one woman. It’s more exciting to play like this.”

This party was originally to find a relationship. When Zhou Keyu said this, no one would refuse.

Zhou Yanyao lowered her head shyly and said with a red face, “Then wouldn’t I be leftover?”

Zhou Keyu can also be regarded as an experienced person, and instantly understood the other’s meaning. 

If you really want to play, how could there be extra? At worst, they would play twice. But she said so, isn’t it (because) she took interest in Xiao Chen, the only one not playing?

The candle’s flame swayed more fiercely, and everyone in the room looked a little gloomy, half their face in the dim light and half their face in the dark.

Zhou Keyu hesitated again and again, and then shouted, “Xiao Chen, come and play for a round, just give everyone face.” 

Ah.

(They) didn’t know who let out a bitter laugh.

As soon as Zhou Keyu finished speaking, he shivered all over his body, and his heart seemed to be pricked by something, somewhat stinging, and from head to toe he was ice-cold.

Xiao Chen let out a breath and sighed, seeing everyone staring at him all together, and had not choice but to go. 

“OK then.”

Ah.


There was an indescribable chill in the room.

The afterimages of everyone mingled on the walls, slightly distorted. 

Xiao Chen sat down and looked around, inexplicably feeling a sense of disobedience in his heart.

Everyone was all in an expressionless state, and it was actually a little frightening to really look at, just like everyone was holding some magical ceremony.

Zhou Keyu placed a pen on the surface of the thin paper lying on the ground, tilted his head, and asked, “Who wants to go first?”

Li Yewen was already eager to try, and immediately opened her lips without hesitation, “I’ll go!” 

The boys exchanged tactful glances, giving the opportunity to Yuan Daqiang.

Yuan Daqiang was a little excited, after all, this was a good opportunity to shake hands with his goddess.

“Biaxian, bixian, I am your past life, you are my present life, please draw a circle on the paper when you hear my call.”

Everyone was absorbed, with faint excitement on their faces.

Yuan Daqiang and Li Yewen sat on the floor, face to face, holding the pen together with their fingers in a position similar to orchid fingers.

The two people lowered their heads, and the candlelight hit their faces, showing silhouettes of light and shadow.

Originally, Li Yewen’s hair draped over both sides (of her face). This movement of lowering her head spread her hair directly to the front. From the perspective of Xiao Chen, she looked like Sadako with her hair.

He looked at this strange scene in front of him. 

Xiao Chen eyelid inexplicably twitched, and had a slightly bad premonition.

Yuan Daqiang and Li Yewen called out dozens of times, the nib was still motionless, and the surrounding air was on the verge of freezing.

Li Yewen was already yelling somewhat impatiently, her face was a little unhappy, and her brows were slightly wrinkled.

Xiao Chen stared at the pen, looking at the shadow on the paper, a little absentminded. 

Through the darkness, the shadow slowly attached himself onto Xiao Chen’s back, and put his arms around Xiao Chen’s waist.

Xiao Chen seemed to sense something, his whole body shuddered, and looked back behind him.

The huge drawing room, the kitchen beside it, the ktv, the card room, the washroom, their doors were are open, but no light was turned on, only black could be seen, a person’s naked eyes couldn’t tell what was inside.

It was unknown if Xiao Chen’s inert lack of a sense of security was the reason, but this kind of imperceptible sense of unknowing made his heart beat somewhat irregularly. 

Every time he found himself in the darkness, it was just like worrying something was under your bed. Waking up in the middle of the night and seeing a pair of eyes unmoving eyes fixed on you. Opening the door and some thing was standing behind it.

The more you think about it, the more terrified you feel. Xiao Chen fixed his mood and turned his head stiffly. 

Force yourself not to think about it.

Keke.

A gust of wind blew, unknowing of how it penetrated the room, lifting the edges of everyone’s clothes.

It’s freezing. 

Li Yewen inexplicably felt a little flustered, and was preparing to let go and stop playing.

Suddenly, she noticed that the nib shook slightly.

Li Yewen became stiff from head to toe, her complexion changed.

Under the full view of everyone, the pen finally moved!! 

The girls made gasped in fright, covering their mouths and noses, for fear that they would disturb the spiritual ritual in front of them.

The tip of the pen is turned and twisted, moving very slowly, like a snail.

Yuan Daqiang swallowed his spit, and went to see Li Yewen’s complexion subconsciously. He didn’t know if he was being teased by Zhou Keyu last time. His mindset was not very convinced of this spirit summoning play.

The surrounding temperature began to inexplicably lower, and even the candle flame shook violently. 

The girls hugged each other in twos, covering their eyes with their hands, and watched the spirit calling ceremony with some nervousness.

The pen nib shook slowly on the paper, barely turning in a circle.

“Pong pong” Xiao Chen’s heartbeat began to accelerate, beating faster and faster. The blood vessels of his brain seemed to burst, his face was pale.

The shadow seemed to sense his body’s tension and rubbed his neck. 

Xiao Chen only felt that his neck was a little cold, his hands clenched into fists.

Don’t be afraid!

I will protect you!

Xiao Chen’s eyes froze, his movements stopped. 

He felt he was having auditory hallucinations.

Xiao Chen swallowed.

That voice really sounded like Gu Luming.

Thinking of this, Xiao Chen’s face (became) even more ugly. 

Bixian was summoned, what questions should be asked?

Yuan Daqiang glanced at Li Yewen again. She seemed to be scared stupid, rigidly staying in place without any movement, closing her mouth tightly.

He could even feel that Li Yewen’s hand was somewhat cold, even frighteningly stiff.

A little like an ice cube, inexplicably feeling a bit like a corpse lying in a morgue. 

Yuan Daqiang shivered and couldn’t help but imagine farfetched scenarios, trembling from the cold, and his scalp was numb.

He internally comforted himself, he must’ve thought too much.

But seeing that Bixian seems to have been summoned, it’s not good for him to keep silent.

Yuan Daqiang braced himself, reluctantly opened his mouth, and directly asked a simple question, “Bixian, how old am I this year.” 

The eyes of the people next to him were focused, faintly anticipating.

The tip of the pen moved, and once again turned and twisted at a snail-like speed.

The candlelight illuminated the paper, and the faint brightness did not look very real.

21. 

Yuan Daqiang looked at the digits on the paper, and the cold sweat dripped down on his forehead.

These two characters were completed in one stroke, and they looked even uglier than the characters of elementary school students, without any sense of beauty.

But at the same time it can be easily discerned.

Correct answer!! 

Zhou Keyu and the people around him looked into each other's eyes for confirmation, as if they were asking whether they thought Yuan Daiqiang might have moved the pen with his hand.

Xiao Chen held his breath and froze in place without moving.

He didn’t know whether others saw it or not, but a moment ago, just between the blinks of an eye, he clearly saw a pair of withered and rotten yellow bones holding the pen nib in its hands.

Before he could see it clearly, it suddenly disappeared, as if the scene before him just a moment ago was just an illusion.

At this moment, Yuan Daqiang suddenly realized a serious problem. 

He only knows how to summon Bixian, but he doesn’t know how to send Bixian away!

His goddess didn’t even say a word the whole time, as if she was scared silly, she didn’t seem like a person who knew how to play Bixian.

For him, it was simply difficult to both move forward or back down.

Fuck! 

Is it possible to directly let go?

Yuan Daqiang’s palm was completely cold and sweaty, and the hand holding the pen trembled slightly.

So, he was on the verge of falling apart, and he cast his eyes on Zhou Keyu next to him for help.

The latter closely followed the two’s summoning ceremony. After receiving Yuan Daqiang’s gaze, Zhou Keyu frowned in confusion. 

Seeing those two eyes that were particularly bright in the reflection of the candlelight, he hesitated for a moment and suddenly had a flash of inspiration.

The brothers next to him looked on at his series of ridiculous movements with confusion on their faces, and almost directly asked why they didn't continue.

If it weren’t for the Bixian ritual underway, when other people could not speak, how could they hold back with all their strength?

Zhou Keyu took a breath and moved his mouth, repeating three words non-stop.

Yuan Daqiang didn’t see clearly at first. He narrowed his eyes, followed Zhou Keyu’s mouth and tried to make his mouth shapes. 

Just say it!

Yuan Daqiang brows jumped.

“Bixian, Bixian, I’ve finished asking questions, you can go!”

After he finished speaking, Yuan Daqiang, as if there was something dirty in his hand, quickly let go of the pen. The fear and horror in his two eyes could not be concealed. 

He gasped for breath, only to realize that something was wrong Li Yewen.

His goddess still kept her head down, and the position of holding a pen in her hand remained, as if she had been fixed in place.

Everyone seemed to realize that something was wrong, especially the girls. They recoiled a few steps in horror, and their legs could not stop shaking.

Under the terrified eyes of everyone, Li Yewen finally moved! 

Her body seemed to be electrocuted, and she began to twitch violently, even her facial features were somewhat distorted.

These kinds of convulsions were impossible to act out!

Li Yewen’s lips were also trembling, and the veins on her forehead almost burst, immediately bulging.

What was terrifying was that pen!! 

Li Yewen’s hand slipped off the pen, but the pen seemed to be fixed on the paper and did not fall down at all!

The next scene completely shocked everyone.

The ball-point pen, without any supporting force, as if it had a life of its own, moved madly on the thin paper surface.

Just like a madman, the movements got faster and faster, just like a high-speed top, it even directly pierced the white paper! 

“Hiss-”

“Shasha–”

Something terrible happened!

The ink spit out from the black ballpoint pen was not black at all, it had directly turned into scarlet blood! 

Even the liquid stains spit out were not the viscosity of a ballpoint pen’s (ink), but body fluid! More and more red body fluid, more and more!

Almost everyone was scared stiff.

Xiao Chen’s face was dreadfully pale, all his blood was boiling, even his heart was about to jump out of his chest!

The shadow felt Xiao Chen’s panic, and then narrowed his eyes, a little angry. 

In a space invisible to the naked eye, there was more and more black energy on his body, almost covering the whole house.

Gloomy, insane, and cold-blooded.

How dare you scare my baby!

Kekeke.

At the moment when everyone was still reacting, the pen was the first to “pa” and fell down on the paper!

Together with Li Yewen, who had completely lost consciousness, she fell down with a “pong“.

Silence.

The girls seemed to only realize what had happened a step late, and (began) hugging each other and screaming madly. 

“Ahhhhh!”

Their screams seemed to shatter people’s eardrums and penetrate walls, extremely ear-piercing.

Zhou Yanyao had been sitting at Xiao Chen’s side the entire time. She subconsciously grabbed Xiao Chen’s clothes and hid her entire body behind him.

Xiao Chen was unguarded and was directly attacked by someone, he even jumped two steps, frightened by the one hiding behind him. 

But he was still held in the arms of the other girl.

Kekeke.

The moment Xiao Chen was hugged, his subconscious nearly ripped off the hands of the person forcibly holding his clothes.

He hated physical contact with people. 

Zhou Yanyao was almost flung off by him.

When Xiao Chen realized what he had done and saw the other party’s embarrassed posture, he paused, but didn’t intend to help her.

He just dryly said a few words, “Sorry.”

Kekekeke.

The people next to him didn’t have time to pay attention to the situation there, because the scene was already so chaotic that even the boys were scared almost to the point of peeing their pants.

It was Zhou Keyu who reacted the fastest, he immediately rushed to the place where the light switch was and suddenly turned on the power.

In an instant, it was brightly lit.

Zhang Hui’s teeth were still chattering up and down. He was gasping in air and shouted loudly, “Call 120!” 

It was at this critical juncture that Xiao Chen suddenly closed his eyes and fainted.


“Hey, hey, have you heard? The freak in our class is dead!”

“What ?! No way! Don’t talk nonsense.” 

“Ah? Dead? How did he die?”

“I heard that the body was found on the street off-campus. Reportedly he fought with the homeless people in that street in order to grab a cake, and then was beat to the death by the homeless people!”

“My God, this is too terrible.”

“For a cake? This is too sensationalized! Isn’t it just a cake?” 

When Xiao Chen heard the voice of the person next to him, his head began to feel faint. His right hand tightly clutched his chest, while his left hand was firmly propped up on the table to maintain his balance.

In front of his eyes, he was seeing stars and everything around him looked unreal. What was terrifying was that his body began shaking all over, like chaff in a sieve.

The people next to him who were still talking quickly noticed that something was wrong with him, and looked over in horror.

Xiao Chen leaned down and began to retch. His stomach was churning incomparably fierce, but he could not spit out anything after retching and holding his position for a long time. If only he could only spit out the acid in his throat, but he couldn’t vomit.

Although everyone didn’t like to pay attention to him normally, they were still just children and their mind was not as complex as adults. As soon as they saw Xiao Chen like this, someone rushed out to call the teacher.

It was as if Xiao Chen’s entire body was cramping. His body kept shaking, crazily shaking, he tried to clasp his hands together to prevent himself from shaking too much, but the result was just in vain.

Instead, he trembled even more terribly.

Gu Luming. 

Xiao Chen’s upper lip incessantly rubbed against his lower teeth. He could hear the sound of the world he had built with great difficulty crashing down, shattering very loudly and completely.

He couldn’t see clearly the faces of the people around him, nor the surrounding environment. He could only feel that he was dizzy.

The next second, he lost his center of gravity and slid on his chair, both knees softened. His upper body had no support, hitting the ground directly.

In the chaos, he saw one face after another, even heard countless screams and shouts, and someone rushed up to catch him, gasping. 

“Xiao Chen.”

“Hm?”

“Do you like to eat the little desserts from the shop across from the school?”

“…How did you know?” 

“Heehee, then I’ll bring you some on the way to school tomorrow!”

“Ye! Okay!”

Xiao Chen suddenly opened his eyes, looked at the surrounding white, and zoned out, as if he was in a dream.

For a moment, he even thought he was back to that summer. 

He tightly clutched at his chest, there was a kind of inexplicable twisting pain in his heart.

He dreamt of that person again!

It was a nightmare that he has been unable to escape for so many years.

“Xiao Chen.” That person’s tone calling him still echoed in his brain. Even the last syllable of that person calling him, and the slightly raised corner of his mouth, he remembered it all clearly. 

I haven’t forgotten, nor can I forget.

Xiao Chen was somewhat silent.

The black shadow hid under the bed, like a viper living in a deep ditch, clinging to Xiao Chen’s side.

Heehee, this was his baby. 

“You’re awake?” A nurse came in, switched out a bottle of medicine for him, and had him continue the iv drip. While changing it on his side, the nurse said, “Your friend has gone to the toilet, I reckon he will be back in a while.”

Xiao Chen nodded, his face remained very pale.

He was in a trance for a moment, suddenly wondering why he was lying here.

Zhang Hui had just finished going to the toilet and walked in. Seeing that Xiao Chen woke up, his eyes lit up. 

“Thank the heavens, brother, you’re awake!” Zhang Hui walked in with a look of excitement, holding in his hand the stomach filling food he had just stopped over to buy.

He directly placed the food at his bedside.

It was a bag of bread rolls and sweets.

Xiao Chen looked at it out of the corner of his eye, unknowing of what to think again, and was a little distracted. 

“Come on, have some food.” Zhang Hui tore the packaging of a little cake and then placed it on Xiao Chen’s hand.

Xiao Chen was silent. After a long time, he put the little cake back on the table, “I don’t like sweets.”

Zhang Hui didn’t doubt him.

Xiao Chen took the initiative to ask, “How is everyone? Why did I suddenly faint yesterday?” 

Zhang Hui just took a bite of bread and paused, sighing, “How else can it be, everyone is scared half to death, especially Yuan Daqiang, who is still shivering all over in the dorm.

“Li Yewen was also admitted to the hospital, but it seems that she was discharged this morning. It’s not like you, who fainted for so long.” Zhang Hui sounded like he was complaining, but in fact, he was full of concern.

Xiao Chen nodded understandingly.

“The doctor said that you are fine, just that you’re somewhat hypoglycemic and your body is a bit weak.” Zhang Hui sighed helplessly. 

Xiao Chen pulled out a smile, “I’m fine, you go back first, don’t you have class today? Please help me ask for leave.”

Zhang Hui nodded, “Alright, you have a good rest.”

After Zhang Hui left, Xiao Chen lay quietly on the bed alone, looking at the sky outside the window, and was lost in thought for a long time.

“Do you like this book that much?” The grey-eyed boy lovably sat next to Xiao Chen, and stared at Xiao Chen brightly. 

Xiao Chen’s hand turned the page, and then he nodded lightly.

“I don’t like it.” The grey-eyed boy narrowed his eyes.

Xiao Chen was a bit puzzled. This was the first time he heard the boy so clearly expressing his dislike of something, that he turned his head to look at him and asked, “Why?”

“Because as long as you are reading this book, you won’t remember that I am sitting beside you!” 

The boy said, aggrieved and mumbling to himself, like a pekingese abandoned by their owner, pitiful.

The scene that fell on Xiao Chen’s eyes was really cute and funny.

He hooked the corner of his mouth and smiled.

This smile was very beautiful in the boy’s eyes. He was dazed, and his whole person was stunned in place. 

The sun shone well on the side of Xiao Chen’s face, turning into a faint halo circle. His auspicious phoenix-shaped eyes narrowed slightly, full of stars, reflecting the boy’s figure.

The boy not only looked foolish, but also felt his face turn completely red.

Xiao Chen rolled his eyes and continued, “Then let me read it to you.” 

The boy’s eyes lit up, he immediately adjusted himself and was ready to listen to the story.

“To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys.”

“And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.”

“But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world…” (“The Little Prince“)

Xiao Chen’s voice was very pleasant, like cold spring water, very clean, a soft voice, impeccable diction, every word, every syllable was entirely perfect, striking the boy’s soft heart.

Together with the whole world, it seemed incomparably gentle. 

You are the only one in my world.

Xiao Chen came back to his senses with great difficulty, and secretly decided to do something in his heart that he had always wanted to but never did.

He simply put on his clothes, went through the discharge procedures, and left the hospital expressionlessly.

The entire way he was silent like always, having a map open on his phone and purposefully heading to a location.

Finally, after making several turns and walking into an alley, he reached his destination. 

He looked at the number at the door, paused, and walked in.

“Handsome guy, what kind of tattoo do you want to get?” The tattoo artist in the shop was a girl who looked like a tomboy. She was very cool, with yellow hair and all kinds of tattoos all over her neck and arms.

Xiao Chen sat down, pursed his lips, took out a picture from his wallet, and looked up at the tattoo artist, “I want to get the tattoo in this photo.”

The tattoo artist nodded, took the picture, and there was a flash of amazement flashed in her eyes. 

It was a combination of a snake and red roses.

A snake coiled in roses.

Roses have always represented passionate romance, and roses in the language of flowers meant a combination of love and its absence.

But snakes were just the opposite. Since ancient times, snakes have been symbolized as animals of mysterious power. In the Bible, a snake tricked Eve into stealing the forbidden fruit, the original sin. 

She’s never seen someone ask for a snake wrapped around a rose tattoo.

More so, this bundle of roses was covered with thorns, but the snake tightly strangled it, wishing that its flesh would be pierced by the sharp thorns of the rose, and let its own blood water the rose.

“Are you sure?” the tattoo artist asked him repeatedly.

A tattoo was permanent, it will follow a person for a lifetime. There were too many cases in the world where tattoos were regretted. 

Xiao Chen did not hesitate, nodded and opened his mouth slightly, “Yes, I want to tattoo it on my back.”

The tattoo artist understood.

The shadow hid in a crack on the ceiling, staring at Xiao Chen’s face with a foolish expression.

It seems that no matter how much he looks, it isn’t enough. He itches to tear open his bones into his stomach, hide him, and slowly enjoy him. 

Keke, truly good looking.

This was his unique and unrivalled treasure

Hee hee.

“What are you drawing?” As soon as Xiao Chen came over, he noticed the boy’s movements and was a little surprised to see the boy painting. 

He didn’t expect that the boy could actually draw.

Xiao Chen looked closer and found that it was a portrait of a snake wrapped around a rose.

The impact of the picture is very strong.

The boy’s gray eyes flashed with some indescribable obscure emotion. 

“Do you like it?” He asked Xiao Chen instead.

Xiao Chen heard the words and carefully looked at the painting.

To be honest, it was a bit scary at first glance, because the snake was truly too realistic, just like a real one, but after looking it a few times, it inexplicably struck a chord with Xiao Chen, It even made him feel speechless to the point of feeling like crying.

“I like it.” Xiao Chen nodded honestly. 

It’s truly beautiful.

The grey-eyed boy smiled. This smile was a little different from his usual smile. Instead, it was a little scary, even a little cold, but his smile was somewhat sweet, like a child who stole candy.

The boy pointed at the rose in the picture and stared closely at Xiao Chen. “This is you.”

He pointed to the snake again and continued, “And this is me.” 

Xiao Chen looked at him with some astonishment.

The corner of the boy’s mouth raised in a dazzling arc, “On the little prince’s planet B612, the bundle of roses looking forward to love finally met Mr. Snake who accidentally broke into the planet one day. Mr. Snake fell in love with the rose at first sight and was determined to protect it, so that the rose that should have lived in the greenhouse could be a proud and dazzling rose again…”

Gu Luming will definitely protect Xiao Chen.


The dazzling sunlight was blinding.

Xiao Chen slightly blocked the sun from his eyes with his hands, and squinted. 

Suddenly, he turned around and looked at his shadow. Looking at the outline of the shadow on the ground, Xiao Chen inexplicably felt a peculiar feeling in his heart.

“I want to be your shadow.” Someone once said that to him.

Xiao Chen jolted, and slapped his temple.

He has been thinking of that person more and more recently. 

Xiao Chen could still feel some faint pain where his back tattoo was, but these pains were still within an acceptable range to Xiao Chen.

The shadow slowly slipped onto Xiao Chen’s calf, and then slowly spread upwards; thighs, buttocks, all the way up, and squeezed into Xiao Chen’s coat.

It looked at the tattoo on Xiao Chen’s back foolishly, stroking gently, looking at the remaining blood stains. It was a bit distressed for him, but it couldn’t conceal the excitement and madness inside.

Mine! This is mine!

Heehee.

Just as one of Xiao Chen’s legs stepped within the school gates, he suddenly raised his head and realized that something was wrong.

“Boom!” A noise sounded, and the dark sky flashed with a clap of thunder.

Xiao Chen’s keen ears stirred and began to discern the sound. 

Before he could calm down, the colour of the sky dimmed visibly to the naked eye. What was more terrifying was that the street, which was definitely packed and crowded a moment ago, was suddenly without a soul in sight, leaving him standing alone.

Thousands of miles without clouds, leaving only darkness.

Xiao Chen’s heart suddenly thumped.

The world spun. 

As if wrapped in a layer of darkness.

What was happening?!

Xiao Chen was terrified.

The surroundings were silent and so dark that he couldn’t see his outstretched fingers. 

No moon, no stars, even no street lights …

Everything around him was indistinct, there was only an endless darkness before his eyes.

As if in an instant, he was transported into a different world.

Thunder rolled and lightning flashed. 

“Rumble, boom–!”

A loud sound.

Xiao Chen trembled again.

The instant the lightning flashed, he barely just recognized the overall surrounding environment. 

Indeed, he was still at the school gate.

He listened to the deafening thunder and clenched his fists.

Damn it! What happened! Was he dreaming?

But everything in front of his eyes seemed incomparably real, undoubtedly false. 

The pitch black sky occasionally split into cracked halves, producing a golden light, and then was followed by a tremendously loud noise that lasted (for what felt like) a few days, wanting to break the world into pieces.

This fear of being in the dark and knowing nothing about the world (around him) made Xiao Chen tremble and let out a cold breath, his scalp somewhat numb.

“Rustle–”

Something floated past him and made a sound. 

In Yu Guangzhong, Xiao Chen could only see a white shadow.

Xiao Chen’s eyes widened, the soles of his feet felt a little numb. He began to sweat all over, and even goose bumps began to rise.

“Crack crack–”

Like the sound of bones being crushed 

The white figure first appeared behind Xiao Chen, waiting for him to turn around, and then changed to his side, again and again.

Threateningly cold energy, cold and terrifying.

In the endless night, only the white figures were floating.

“Heehee heehee ha ha ha ha–” 

Like there were ghosts, intangible echoes came from all around.

It was like being ridiculed, with a sense of unreality.

Xiao Chen’s blood was about to freeze, his two legs were fixed in place, motionless, as if his brain exploded.

G-ghosts! 

The white ghost jumped out from behind him suddenly, revealing a face so deathly pale it was as if it was painted with a layer wall-paint. There were no eyeballs in his open eyes, only two bloody bone sockets.

Xiao Chen shook all over and his legs softened. He was frightened to the point that he sat on the ground. He subconsciously stretched out his two hands and immediately blocked his eyes.

“…”

The expected pain did not arise. 

Xiao Chen opened his eyes, trembling, carefully taking off his hands a little, and looked at around through his fingers.

“…”

As soon as he opened his eyes a little, he was stunned by the scene in front of him.

The white ghost’s throat was held in a chokehold by a shadow who had come out of nowhere, tightly squeezing its neck and lifting it up directly. 

“Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah–”

The white ghost let out a shrill and sharp cry, like a sound a person being burnt alive by fire would make, it was ear-piercing and terrifying.

If it weren’t for the close distance between them, Xiao Chen wouldn’t even be able to see the outline of the shadow.

“Thump thump, thump thump.” Xiao Chen’s heartbeat began to accelerate. 

His mouth widened slightly and his pupils trembled.

“Rumble, boom.” Lightning flashed from time to time in the sky, and then a tremendous loud noise.

With the few seconds of light emitted by the lightning, Xiao Chen could vaguely see the outline of the shadow.

The shadow clutched the white ghost’s throat, slowly turned his head back, and met Xiao Chen’s shocked eyes with the flash of light. 

The two were speechless.

The white ghost seized the opportunity, and the moment the shadow was absentminded, it turned into a puff of white smoke and quickly slipped away.

The shadow did not give chase.

Xiao Chen gasped, his eyes were a little wet, and her entire face was shuddering. 

The shadow walked slowly towards where Xiao Chen was sitting.

Xiao Chen wanted to stand up, but the fright just now made him panic. He lost a lot of strength, and he softened and almost fell.

The shadow had quick eyes and quick hands, and quickly supported Xiao Chen’s body.

Xiao Chen raised his head and moved his mouth, wanting to say something, but the next second, the sky began to change again. 

The dark clouds faded away, the sky was clear for thousands of miles, and the sun was shining brightly.

Those who had disappeared a moment ago again appeared in Xiao Chen’s sight.

Outside, there was the sound of endless traffic and the voices of students walking around.

Xiao Chen’s heartbeat was still beating fast, but the shadow in front of him has disappeared into nothingness, as if everything he just experienced was nothing but his imagination! 

If he hadn’t seen the mud that stuck on his leg after he just fell, Xiao Chen was afraid that even he would think that he was just dreaming.

Xiao Chen covered his heart again.

He could feel some dull pain there.

Gu Luming. 

Is it you?

The shadow did not disappear, but Xiao Chen had no way of seeing this for himself at this moment.

Xiao Chen squatted down, sitting directly at the school gate, and under the startled eyes of the crowd walking back and forth, he covered his face and burst into tears.

This was the first time he had cried since Gu Luming left, so many years. 

Heart-wrenchingly grieving, regardless of location, time, and occasion.

It didn’t seem to match his usual calm and even indifferent appearance at all.

The shadow directly held him in his arms, even if the other party could not feel his existence.

Don’t cry, don’t cry, I’m here. 

Wait for me to get a little stronger, you’ll be able to see me.

Hold on! Hold on!

Soon!

“Look! Look! The female dorms are on fire!” 

It was unknown who suddenly shouted in the crowd. Instantly, everyone’s eyes looked towards where the female dormitory was almost at the same time.

A plume of black smoke escaped through the glass windows.

Looking from a distance, you can see a long plume of black smoke drifting upward.

After hearing that voice, the security guard at the door ran out of the security room, and sprinted to the scene of the fire. He picked up his walkie-talkie and started frantically calling for help. 

“A fire broke out in the girls’ dormitory! Everyone, quickly grab a fire extinguisher and prepare to put out the fire! Hurry up and call someone to evacuate the crowd and rescue people! Don’t forget to remember to dial the fire station!”

“Go, go, go!”

Xiao Chen raised his head amidst the hustle and bustle, there were tears in the corners of his eyes.

He leaned on the wall and slowly stood up. 

The people next to them were attracted by the plumes of black smoke, discussing in low voices, and there were even more people who didn’t think it was a big deal and came to watch the fun.

Simply put, this fire was not too big, and it was successfully extinguished in a shore time because it was discovered in a timely manner, it didn’t have time to spread.

The security team organized the students at top speed to leave the scene, in an orderly fashion, without any trampling accidents.

In the end, the group of security guards who put out the fire finally breathed a sigh of relief. They began to check the bedroom that was the source of the fire. 

One of them seemed to find something. His eyes widened in horror, his pupils quaking. He then pointed his finger in one direction, swallowed his saliva, and said in a panic, “Is that a person?”

Everyone followed and looked at the direction he was pointing at. He pointed to a mass of something black underneath the bed. The mass had been burnt into black charcoal. At a glance, it was impossible to tell what shape it was.

The security guards exchanged glances.

The horror they saw in each other’s eyes. 

Finally, someone stepped forward, mustering up the courage, and walked over.

He pushed that thing with a fire extinguisher.

Bang, bang. Hard.

Shit, it’s really human. 

How many days has it been? Fatal accidents occurred in both the male and female dormitories!

If this kind of news gets out, how will the school deal with it again?

Fuck.

“Beep beep beep.” The phone in Xiao Chen’s pocket vibrated. 

He was still standing there, unmoving.

Xiao Chen took out his mobile phone from his pocket, and his eyes were still somewhat absentminded.

It was Chen Liu.

“Hello.” Xiao Chen’s voice was still weak. 

The voice on the other end of the phone was like a madman, speaking very fast, shouting loudly, “Xiao Chen, you must pay attention to safety during this time, be careful about every single thing, just today, all the people in our dormitory were…”

Before the person could finish speaking, Xiao Chen heard a sudden “click” on the other end of the phone, followed by the sound of the car skidding against the ground while braking. Then something was knocked over with a loud “DUANG.”

In the end, it returned to peace.

There was a moment of silence. 

“AHHHHH–”

There were piercing screams all around Xiao Chen, and someone even knelt on the ground next to him, their legs weak.

There was a car accident behind him.

Xiao Chen’s face was pale, his stiff body slowly turned around. He felt that his blood had completely frozen. He looked like a zombie. 

When he saw the person lying on the ground behind him clearly, he could no longer deceive himself.

The hand holding his mobile phone slid from his ear, and the phone fell straight to the ground, the screen shattering into pieces.

There was a lot of clamouring all around, but Xiao Chen seemed to be deaf, unable to hear anything. There were only bursts of ringing in his ears.

Before his eyes was a blur of blood. 

The driver of the car came out of the driver’s seat, his legs still trembling, and he almost fell to his knees every few steps. He walked over with difficulty to confirm the condition of the person he hit.

Not breathing.

The eyes were still open, and the pupils were unfocused.

The victim was lying on the ground in an extremely twisted posture, and blood was still pouring out of him. 

The car owner’s eyes were black, and his heart thumped.

It’s over!

Chen Liu is dead.



(If) God loves the world, why is there still evil on earth?

Xiao Chen’s eyes were empty. Next to him sat the four other people in boy’s dormitory 404 and the five other people who played with Bixian last time.

Why is it five and not six?

Because of the fire in the girl’s dormitory, the fire originated in their dormitory, and the one who died was the one who had a crush on Xiao Chen, Zhou Yanyao.

When the fire broke out, Zhou Yanyao was the only one in the entire dormitory. Why the fire started, they didn’t know.

The girls quietly sobbed, crying a little.

“What should I do? What should I do? Will I die?”

“I’m so young, I don’t want to die, wuwuwu.”

The girls hugged each other in pairs and wept bitterly. Everyone’s nerves collapsed.

In such a short time, less than a day, two people died!

Even today, they, to some extent, brushed shoulders with Death.

Nearly was smashed by a flower pot, nearly almost rolled down the stairs, or even nearly ate poisonous food.

Everyone was going crazy (from the) torment!

Damn it!

The shadow rubbed Xiao Chen’s hair, inhaled his body’s scent, laughed, and the let out a content sigh.

Seeing Xiao Chen’s brows tighten, he touched Xiao Chen’s brows with his hand, trying to soothe his frustration.

Xiao Chen’s eyelids jumped.

He felt the strange touch.

He didn’t know if it was because he saw that shadow resembling Gu Luming during the day, especially since he became aware that there were really ghosts and monsters in this world.

(But) he couldn’t help but wonder if Gu Luming was by his side.

As long as he thought about it for a moment, his still heart thumped and throbbed extraordinarily fast, like a spring of rebirth had burst forth.

“It’s all my fault!” Zhou Keyu slapped himself suddenly, making a sharp and clear sound.

Everyone glanced at him and didn’t speak.

Zhou Keyu’s eyes were red and swollen from crying, and he was the colour of dust.

If it wasn’t for his proposal, why would everyone play Bixian?

Zhou Keyu covered his eyes with both hands and burst into tears.

This was the first time since he had grown so big that he cried so loudly without regard to his image, even crying until he was short of breath.

If it wasn’t for him!

Liu-zi wouldn’t have been run over by a car!

Everyone wouldn’t have sunk into this panic!

Damn it! Fucking damn it!

Li Yewen, who was sitting beside him, seemed to be in a trance, no joy nor sorrow.

She didn’t say a word or shed a tear the entire time, her pupils were completely empty.

Since she fainted and woke up that night, until now, her state had been like this.

Like a person whose soul and spirit had been hooked away, her whole person was lost.

Amidst the disheartened voices, Li Yewen suddenly stood up.

The attention of everyone around her fell on her instantly.

Their faces filled with suspicion.

She glanced at everyone present without expression; standing in place, her eyes swept through everyone there.

Her head slightly crooked to the side of her neck somewhat weakly. Her scattered and spread out hair blocked out half of her face, and then her eyes moved left and right.

Her movements were a bit stiff, and she didn’t look very flexible. Coupled with the eerie Yin temperament she exuded throughout her body, there was an unspeakable uncanniness.

She pulled up the corners of her mouth, and the splitting movement was very stiff, like a clown-like marionette, the smile couldn’t reach her eyes. Contrarily, it was creepy, and made people’s hair stand on end and their backs turn cold.

There was a sudden silence around her, watching her every move in horror.

Just when everyone thought she was going to do something, she burst out in mischievous laughter.

This laugh seemed to have its own echo, and it was a little hoarse. It sounded completely different from the voice of a 19-year-old girl, it was more like the voice of an old woman from hell who had half a leg in the ground!

Those who heard (the sound) hairs stood up sharply, their backs feeling cold.

But within a few seconds, Li Yewen restrained her expression and restored the wooden face she just had, changing face very quickly!

She turned around and walked straight forward, without turning her head, she walked towards the door exit, not knowing where she was going.

She turned around and without turning her head, she walked straight forward, walking to the exit without knowing where she was going.

The people around looked at each other in dismay, and made up their minds. Everyone was so horrified that they held their breaths, and no one stopped her

The people around looked at each other in blank dismay, and in a word, everyone was so shocked that they held their breath, and no one stopped her.

Yuan Daqiang was the fastest to react. He was still in love with Li Yewen. Out of care and affection, he gritted his teeth and then followed without hesitation.

In a loud voice, he called out, “Wait for me!”

The remaining few stared at their departing figures and finally looked at each other.

Wang Jiahao already had little courage. He cursed somewhat angrily, clenched his right hand into a fist and smashed it into the wall. “Fuck, what’s all this!!!”

A girl with two ponytails lifted her head, shaking and trembling. Her eyes appeared to have already been crying, (they were) awfully red. Her lips, because of her tension, were bitten split.

She submissively opened her mouth to say, “I heard that the boy who died suddenly in the boy’s dormitory a few days ago, also played Bixian the day before his death!”

“Pong!”

One sentence set off a wave of terror.

“Fuck! Why didn’t you say it earlier while we were playing!” A girl with a middle part beside her pinched a red mark on the twin-tailed girl’s arm.

Twin-tails cried out, but did not dare resist. It seemed that she was bullied often ordinarily.

Twin-tails wanted to cry but had no tears, and shrunk into a ball, “I, I don’t know that he died because of Bixian.”

She knew that the boy played with Bixian and she didn’t know that the boy died because of it.

She knew that there was no contradiction between the boy playing Bixian and didn’t know that the boy died because of it.

For a moment, everyone was discouraged and looked at each other speechless.

Do they want to die?

Of course not!

But they were still lucky enough to think that perhaps the deaths of those two were nothing but accidents.

Maybe I’m the lucky one, maybe I don’t have to die… right?

Despite comforting themselves, the girls couldn’t control their emotions and once again started holding their heads and crying bitterly.

Zhang Hui, on the other hand, jabbed Zhou Keyu’s arm with his elbow and said anxiously, “Big Yu, where did you hear the rules of Bixian from?”

Zhou Keyu paused, his mouth slightly open, slapped his forehead, and said with some excitement, “It was on the school forum! I saw someone saying something about Bixian in it, and I noted it in my head, and then asked if you wanted to play it.”

Beside him, Wang Jiahao’s eyelids twitched. His voice was hoarse, and with slight suspicion in his tone, he gave Zhou Keyu a strange look, “How come I have never seen this post?”

Wang Jiahao is a standard (web)-surfing teenager, and he especially liked to be on the school forum and add everyone in school.

Hearing this, Zhou Keyu showed a disbelieving expression and retorted, “How is that possible, the post had such a high reply rate, it was obviously a hot post!”

After he finished speaking, he hurriedly fished out his mobile phone, clicked open the forum’s home page, wanting to show it to everyone.

But the strange thing was that no matter whether he looked at the homepage of the school forum, or clicked on his favourite browsing history, even his records of post replies, he found nothing.

Zhou Keyu’s cold sweat flowed down, his face ashen, his eyes terrified.

Stuttering, “This, how is this possible?”

The answer is undoubtedly, when he learned of this game, Zhou Keyu had seen the ghost!

Xiao Chen also stood up and sighed, “I’ll buy you some dinner.”

Upon seeing this, Zhang Hui also stood up and said with concern, “I will accompany you!”

Xiao Chen shook his head and said faintly, “It’s okay, I’ll be fine alone. If something really happens, I’m the only one who will die, it won’t drag you down.”

“But,” Zhang Hui wanted to say something.

Xiao Chen opened the dormitory door directly and interrupted, “I’m leaving, I’ll be back soon.”

Xiao Chen doing so had an element of gambling.

He was betting that Gu Luming was at his side and had been following him all this time. Although he didn’t know why he didn’t show himself, he already had an inexplicable certainty in his heart.

He bet that if he encountered danger, Gu Luming could not not appear!

If he loses, it is only death, so many people around him are dead, he really has nothing to fear.

Xiao Chen walked out of the dormitory building and looked up at the sky.

Gu Luming is his lucky star.

Before meeting Gu Luming, he had no friends and didn’t even dare to get close to anyone around him. After Gu Luming left, the curse that everyone would die as soon as he got close to them disappeared.

He had always felt that it was because Gu Luming had helped him.

The black qi on Black Shadow’s body became heavier and heavier, and even the outline of his body became more obvious, more and more three-dimensional.

The day when he could completely transform into human form was getting closer and closer.

Hee hee.

Xiao Chen stopped and found a crowd standing around the door of the cafeteria, the number of people surrounding it was obviously increasing.

Xiao Chen paused, not planning to join in the excitement.

Rounding the corner, he planned to enter the cafeteria.

Before he could enter, his heart sank suddenly and his eyelids twitched.

Footsteps followed closely.

Xiao Chen could even hear his heart’s incessant pounding.

“Help! Help!” The boy lying on the ground was covered in blood, holding his waist and belly tightly with his hands, his eyes widened in horror.

Blood poured through the cracks of his fingers, and dripped to the floor in clumps.

His clothes, pants and even shoes were covered with blood.

The man’s face was pale, his face crazed, and he madly called for help to those around him, “Quickly! Quickly call an ambulance!”

He dragged his heavy body and tried to get a half step closer to the crowd, and the latter moved aside with a look of fear and even disgust.

He dragged himself across the ground and constantly kept trying to get closer to people. There were countless smeared blood marks on the ground.

But from beginning to end, no one was willing to lend a helping hand.

Xiao Chen’s brain filled with blood, and he pushed the crowd away crazily. His actions were very rough and fast, and his strength was so great that the person he pushed almost fell to the ground.

Xiao Chen, with a pale complexion, knelt in front of the boy.

Yuan Daqiang’s desperate eyes instantly lit up, and he shouted, “Xiao Chen, quickly save me!”

Xiao Chen took out his mobile phone from his pocket, opened it, and dialed 120. He gasped, and his breathing became short. He took off his white coat, quickly grabbed Yuan Daqiang’s waist, and tied a knot around the bleeding on his abdomen.

“Yuan Daqiang, Yuan Daqiang! Hold on, the ambulance will come soon!” Xiao Chen was gasping even harder than Yuan Daqiang.

The surrounding students began pointing at them, not knowing what to say. Some were frightened, some were afraid, some were shocked. Their expressions held an inexplicable meaning.

Xiao Chen’s heart thumped even faster, he glanced at the indifferent crowd around him, and took a deep breath.

But apparently Yuan Daqiang is almost unable to hold on, and began convulsing all over.

Looking at the amount of blood on the ground, Xiao Chen could even imagine that Yuan Daqiang had been calling for help here for a long time.

Gu Luming at that time …

Was it the same …

No one helped him until he was beaten to death…

Xiao Chen’s heart suddenly sank.


Late at night.

It was silent. Moonlight from outside the window entered the room, casting a faint halo, barely making the surrounding area visible.

At the hospital.

It was so quiet that it seemed that, in the next second, a corpse would crawl out of the morgue to take someone’s life.

The shadow slowly attached itself to Xiao Chen’s body, a little forward. The yin energy on his body was very dense. He carefully stroked Xiao Chen’s face.

Fragrant.

Keke.

Xiao Chen was lying on a hospital bed, his brow tight, his sleep unsteady. His body was stretched taut and straight, and it was unknown if he was having any nightmares.

A faint light came in and shone on Xiao Chen’s face, and he looked even more pale and translucent.

It was like Sleeping Beauty in the fairy tale, waiting for a prince’s kiss before waking up.

The shadow silently laughed, touched Xiao Chen’s brow, helped him smoothened it, and then gently rubbed Xiao Chen’s thin lips.

Xiao Chen opened his mouth slightly to breathe.

The next second, the shadow that was originally just black mist slowly turned into a solid body. In order not to press on Xiao Chen, he propped himself on both sides of the bed.

And his body slowly changed from the appearance of black mist to human skin.

Grey eyes, long layered hair almost blocking his eyes, a straight-tipped nose, and slightly hooked up lip corners.

His eyes showed obsession and infatuation, with an undisguised desire for possession.

The man’s hand touched the layered hair on Xiao Chen’s forehead, and buried his head in the side of the young man’s neck, his lips feeling up the other’s skin.

Xiao Chen’s sleep was already shallow, and something was wrapped around him. He first shook his head, trying to get rid of the thing that clung to him, but he didn’t expect the ghost to instead stick to him more tightly.

All of a sudden, Xiao Chen woke up from his sleep.

He opened his eyes with difficulty. Half awake, he vaguely saw a familiar face through the weak moonlight outside the window. Xiao Chen was shocked at first.

After swallowing his saliva, he finally saw the face clearly.

After seeing it clearly, his pupils suddenly contracted, and his whole body became stiff on the bed, unable to move, allowing the man to restrain him to the bed.

He looked at the grey eyes, his face reflected in them, without blinking. It lasted for almost half a minute before Xiao Chen let go of the breath he was holding.

Xiao Chen’s lips were trembling slightly. He placed his palm against the man’s cheek, stroking gently, carefully feeling it in the palm of his hand.

The skin was very firm, and it felt good to the touch, it was human skin.

It wasn’t fake.

I’m not dreaming!

Xiao Chen’s eyes were sharp.

The man said nothing, and let Xiao Chen’s two hands begin to stroke his face and body at will, his face indulgent.

Finally, Xiao Chen seemed to be sure that he wasn’t dreaming, but he choked on what he wanted to say in his throat, and he didn’t say a word.

His nose began to tingle, and his eyes were flushed. Without asking anything, he directly wrapped his arms around the man’s waist and pressed it against his abdomen.

The man released his strength, and his whole body pressed down against Xiao Chen.

Gu Luming’s changes were truly a lot.

Not only were his facial features become more three-dimensional than before, but even his height and figure were so far from what they once were.

Gu Luming was half a head shorter than Xiao Chen in the past. Although he was small, you could see the fierceness in him at a glance. He was like a desperatewolf, who would never lightly let off anyone who dared to approach his field.

And Xiao Chen was the only remaining softness in his heart.

But the man in front of him, was not only almost as tall as Xiao Chen, who was 180 metres, but also a head taller, and even the shape of his body had changed greatly.

It could be said that the only thing that remained unchanged...

...was the expression in his eyes when he looked at Xiao Chen.

Gu Luming’s eyes, when he looked at Xiao Chen, were always pampering and smiling, the sense of indulgence reached the bottom of his eyes. Even if they sometimes gave off a cold and even eerie feeling, but as long as his eyes only fell on Xiao Chen, they were bound to be full of love.

“I miss you so much, I miss you so much!” Xiao Chen’s voice trembled, so much that his tone was a little choked. He hugged the man tightly and incessantly repeated those four words.

In fact, he had many questions in his heart, but at that moment, he could not remember them at all. He only told the other person, I miss you very much, just this and nothing more.

Gu Luming turned around and readjusted their postures.

The two were lying sideways on the bed, firmly holding each other in their arms, as if wishing to merge the other into their flesh and blood and to become one with themselves.

“I know! I know.” Gu Luming also repeated these two words, each word was said very seriously, and he was patient answering Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen’s heart thumped and thumped faster, it was entirely as if he had taken an illegal stimulant. His whole body was limp and numb, and it was as if the blood stopped flowing to his brain.

The man’s eyes narrowed, his chin constantly rubbing the side of Xiao Chen’s neck. His strength was greater than Xiao Chen’s. He clasped Xiao Chen’s waist, and both his hands were not well-behaved, caressing/groping Xiao Chen’s back, even tending to head downwards without stopping.

Mine, all mine.

Finally, the man couldn’t hold back any longer, pressed the back Xiao Chen’s neck with one hand, taking advantage of Xiao Chen’s brief daze, and directly sealed the other’s lips with his mouth.

His palm passed up through the hem of Xiao Chen’s jacket, feeling the other’s temperature.

Xiao Chen welcomed the other party’s desire to swallow his kiss.

Both his hands slowly moved to the back of the man’s neck.

It was unknown how long the kiss was before the man released the soon-to suffocate Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen’s eyes slanted upwards, and there were tears in the corners of his eyes. This look had a charm that couldn’t be described by words.

Gu Luming’s eyes narrowed again, and he finally opened his mouth. His voice was husky, and there was even a kind of morbid paranoia in it. He slowly started to speak.

“I can finally meet you, my darling.”

We’ve been waiting too long for this day!

It’s been so long that I almost went crazy! Long enough that I was going to go crazy!

Xiao Chen choked out in a small voice, hugging Gu Luming tightly with both hands, and repeatedly confirming, “Am I dreaming?”

This dream was so beautiful. He has seen the same dream too many times. Every time he was in the dream he was so happy, only for there to be a greater disparity when he awake, furthering his despair.

Despite the fact that Gu Luming was in front of him, in his eyes, it was like a bubble that would burst with a single poke.

Gu Luming felt a burst of sadness. Before he could speak, Xiao Chen directly bit his neck.

It wasn’t a kiss, it was really biting!

It was like a rabbit who was forced to bare its teeth, and then biting tightly, hoping to tear out a large piece of flesh to make the other party feel pain.

Gu Luming’s eyes were motionless, allowing Xiao Chen bite himself willfully, but did not shout out in pain.

Suddenly, Xiao Chen, who had bitten his neck, stopped moving, like a drunken man who suddenly blacks out when he’s drunk. Immediately afterwards, Gu Luming felt a burst of dampness at the location of the wound.

It was Xiao Chen crying.

Xiao Chen’s crying was the kind that was wet and silent. He won’t cry loudly, or even burst into tears, his crying was extremely forbearing. It was as if the wind was gentle and there were barely clouds, but in fact, the waves were turbulent.

Most people couldn’t see how many wounds he had behind his strength.

Gu Luming’s heart clenched. What he couldn’t bear to see the most was Xiao Chen’s tears.

He was franticand wanted to lift Xiao Chen’s head up, but the young man seemed to be afraid of being seen crying, so he buried his head in Gu Luming’s neck, he couldn’t see his expression.

Gu Luming’s heart ached even more terribly, his voice low and trembling, “It’s me! I’m really back.”

He knew what Xiao Chen was worried about and what his apprehensions were.

“I’m back, I’m really back.” The man repeated this sentence over and over again, being more gentle and more patient than ever. He didn’t even know how many times he had said it, but what he did know was that the rigid body in his arms slowly softened.

Finally, Xiao Chen roused up his courage and raised his head again. His hands moved to Gu Luming’s face, grabbing and pulling each side. His eyes were a little red and swollen, revealing a smile that was even uglier than crying, but the smile in the depths of his eyes was sincere, “You are finally back.”

Yuan Daqiang died on the way to the hospital, and Xiao Chen also fainted in the ambulance.

Through surveillance, the police quickly identified the suspect.

The freshman female student at the school, Li Yewen.

The surveillance showed that after the two left the male dorms, the boy wanted to take the girl’s hand, but he didn’t know that the girl was hiding a knife in her pocket. The moment the boy held her hand, she inserted the knife directly into his abdomen, and kept walking, continuing to walk out without changing her face...

Although they have seen many young sweethearts or married couples that were involved in accidental murder cases because of quarrels. they were wall somewhat silent.

Because the girl’s expression on the screen looked so indifferent. After stabbing someone, she didn’t even turn her head back, she walked straight out of the school gate, even her pace was entirely unhurried. They couldn’t see the panic of just killing someone.

Furthermore, no matter how they looked at the surveillance, it isn’t like a crime of passion, let alone like a long-planned modus operandi.

The girls’ movements and expressions seemed to be unconscious instruments.

Strange! Too weird!

What’s even stranger was that the police mobilized all the surveillance cameras near the school, and went as far as to circle the girl. Within half a minute of entering a surveillance blind spot, they could no longer find the girl’s figure anywhere else, as if she disappeared into thin air.

Compared to the uproar caused by this strange case in the police department, and the students’ terror due to the several consecutive homicides, the group in the boy’s dormitory 404 was falling apart.

The group stayed in the dormitory, including the group of girls whose dormitory was burned down, and none dared to leave the dormitory door.

The girls especially did not dare to even drink water, for fear that they would want to go to the toilet, and then they will need to be protected by the boys.

Furthermore, someone died in the boy’s washroom on the fourth floor, how could they be willing to go?

A few people stripped the cupboards and cabinetsand took out all the snacks and instant noodles, and the seven people devoured them right away.

The twin tailed girl was called Wang Qianqian. She cried while eating and her eyes are already swollen from crying. After eating a bite, she sobbed and continued to eat. She was entirely on the verge of collapse and hunger.

“I don’t want to die! wuwu!”

The girls were extremely pessimistic and broken down, but at this time, no boys were qualified to criticize them or even let them cry.

Throughout the night, none of the seven people slept.

Mental collapse, haggard.

They found out for the first time of Xiao Chen sending Yuan Daiqiang to the hospital, but the police blocked that information and did not pass the news of Yuan Daqiang’s death to the students’ ears for the time being.

Compared with everyone’s self-pity and self-hatred, Zhou Keyu used his hacking skills to bypass the firewall and search all over the Internet to search for all information related to Bixian.

For them, this has become the last hope.

Xiao Chen leaned against the man’s arms, his eyes were still sour, and his mood had not yet calmed down. He asked, “Why, why did you come back now?”

Xiao Chen took a deep breath, unknowing what he was thinking, he turned his head away, and his eyes became even redder, “Did you know ...”

He paused with great difficulty, and adjusted his breathing, “Did you know how long I’ve been missing you?”

I dream, and all I dream of is you. I wake up, and my head is filled with you. Lost in thought, thinking about all the little details of our interactions in the past.

Sometimes laughing like a fool, sometimes crying like a lunatic.

He lived in an abyss of self-blame, and for so many years, he had never forgiven himself.

The man’s hand clenched Xiao Chen’s hand tightly and inhaled, intoxicated by the smell of his body, while listening to his complaints.

His morbid eyes were full of possessiveness. He kissed the corner of his eyes in distress, and he said in a deep and meaningful tone, “I know, I know everything.”

He never left!

He was even more miserable than Xiao Chen!

The person he wanted to protect was in front of him, but he couldn’t touch him at all. He could only watch Xiao Chen fall apart and suffer!

He watched the person he loved crying silently at night, unable to sleep, watching him almost get anorexia during that time because of himself, he even became disgusted with his favourite deserts.

No one was more distressed than him, and no one can hate him more than himself!

Thinking of this, the man narrowed his eyes.

After his death, he also saw the malicious spirit that haunted Xiao Chen for more than ten years!

The culprit that caused him to be killed and caused the people around Xiao Chen to die one after another.

The man patted Xiao Chen’s back, comforting his emotions.

If it were not for the purpose of killing the spirit, he almost would have scattered his soul, and he wouldn’t have waited until now to slowly turn into human form, having previously been hidden in the world in the form of a shadow.

There was a tingling in the man’s eyes.

He wouldn’t have let Xiao Chen wait for him for so many years!

“There won’t be another time!” The man solemnly interlocked fingers with Xiao Chen, buried his head in Xiao Chen’s hair, and smelled his body fragrance that could easily arouse him, and moved his chin.

“I swear!”

“This time.”

“I will never leave you!”

I came and walked under the moon only because you were in the mountains. -Xi Murong




“I found a way!” Zhou Keyu, with red bloodshot eyes, had been sitting in front of the computer all night. His hair was a complete mess, he looked unkempt and completely haggard.

Because the fingers of his two hands had rapidly tapped at the keyboard for a long time, his joints seemed to be stiffly curled up.

When he said this sentence, his expression showed a brief and distinct madness, even the corners of his mouth were twitching, and there was a bit of light in his eyes.

“What’s the solution?”

“Really?”

For a moment, the originally gloomy eyes of all the people who had become dejected suddenly became energetic, terrifyingly shiny. They noisily opened their mouths and asked.

Like a swarm of bees, they rushed up, each and every one burning with anxiety.

Zhou Keyu sorted out his emotions and took a deep breath. He simply said, “I just climbed over The Firewall, and saw that abroad, many deaths were caused by playing Bixian.”

Speaking of which, he paused, “...and basically the only reason for their deaths was because they forgot to send away Bixian while playing with Bixian, so they were bitten by Bixian in return.”

Speaking of this, Zhou Keyu’s inner self-blame worsened, and he frowned.

He raised the suggestion of Bixian first. It was all because he instigated others to play around without even knowing the story behind Bixian. He even forgot to tell Yuan Daqiang that he should respectfully ask the Bixian to leave, and that you couldn’t put down the pen until you have confirmed it many times.

Otherwise, today’s terrifying situation wouldn’t have happened.

“So, how can we save ourselves?” Wang Jiahao directly asked the key point, interrupting Zhou Keyu’s nonsense.

“Bixian is a kind of sorcery similar to communicating with and channelling spirits. Therefore, while being entangled with Bixian, it is impossible for people to resist with their own abilities. They can only sit and wait to die.”

As soon as Zhou Keyu finished speaking, everyone’s originally excited faces sank one by one, terribly depressed, blood draining.

“But!” Zhou Keyu gritted out the last syllable, “Although we can’t fight Bixian with our human abilities, evil spirits can!”

“Fight poison with poison, control a spirit with a spirit.”

“If you want to survive, you must summon a stronger Bixian and convince him to protect us!”

In Zhou Keyu’s words, every word was like the gnashing of teeth, the pronunciation was very heavy.

After everyone finished listening to him, not only did they not feel enlightened nor rescued, but on the contrary, they felt dizzy, and that they would certainly die.

At this critical moment, who would dare play Bixian?

Who could guarantee that the next summoned Bixian would be more powerful than this?

Who had the ability to persuade this Bixian to protect everyone?

Zhou Keyu closed his eyes, and there were several deep lines in his cheek because his teeth were clenched tightly.

Finally, he sighed and continued, “If you want to summon the strongest Bixian, then at 12 o’clock at midnight, you must have the person born on the Yin hour on the Yin day of the lunar calendar summon it.

Everyone’s expression collapsed, and they looked at each other in dismay, their expressions changing unpredictably.

Zhou Keyu pulled out an expression that was uglier than crying, and his voice was hoarse, “And among us, there happens to be such a person. He fits these birth conditions perfectly.”

Everyone’s eyes lit up, “Who?”

Zhou Keyu lowered his head, his mouth twitched a little, his fingers clenched into fists, and he said with restraint, “Xiao Chen.”

Zhang Hui’s eyelids jumped, and he had an ominous premonition.

This was when Xiao Chen woke up in the ward, after two days. He skillfully checked himself out and then planned to leave.

However, compared with the last time, when the mood was oppressive and gloomy, Xiao Chen was obviously in a good mood this time.

His face, which was basically gloomy all year round, was now unable to hide the joy in his eyes, and the corners of his mouth were wholly raised all the time.

After a man is transformed from a shadow into a corporeal entity, it is no different from a person.

Whether in appearance or body, it looks like an ordinary person.

Unafraid of light, possessing a shadow, and the sort of feet that didn’t sink through the ground like in the tv shows.

But what made it clear to Xiao Chen that Gu Luming was not a real person was that the man really had no heartbeat, no pulse, nor even body temperature.

However, Xiao Chen did not care about these mere things, he only had to properly accompany Gu Luming.

The two of them talked about their sorrows for almost the whole night, eagerly wishing to confide how they longed to see the other over the years.

Even if they hugged each other tightly, skin sticking on skin, it still felt insufficient.

All their uneasy feelings are slowly crammed into just a few words, and then it was as if they had never been separated.

The two interlocked their fingers and walked out of the hospital doors naturally holding hands, looking like a normal couple.

And Xiao Chen’s person was in an entirely dream-like state, light as a feather.

Both of his eyes anxiously stuck to Gu Luming at all times, for fear that the other person would disappear in the next second.

It wouldn’t be too much to say that the expression in his eyes wasn’t restrained at all.

Gu Luming was also the same. From time to time, he touched the bangs on Xiao Chen’s forehead, messing around with them and taking advantage.

Several times, he couldn’t hold back from kissing Xiao Chen’s gleaming, love-filled eyes, even if there were other people around.

“Our dormitory...” Xiao Chen finally thought of the strange things that had happened in the dormitory recently and frowned, but before he had finished speaking, the man had interrupted him quickly.

“I know.” Gu Luming’s grey eyes glinted, an indescribable emotion flashing.

“You don’t have to worry, they will be fine.” The man scoffed and stroked Xiao Chen’s hair.

Xiao Chen breathed a sigh of relief.

After all, it was a dormitory, and it was impossible to be without feelings.

The man immediately narrowed his eyes, a hint of coldness flashing.

The life and death of those people were not worth mentioning here.

Because what he loves, cares about, and values has always been Xiao Chen alone!

He can go to hell for Xiao Chen and be eternally damned, or he could crawl out of the endless abyss for Xiao Chen.

What does the life and death of others have to do with him?

The man closed his eyes, and firmly suppressed down his murderous hatred, his abnormality that couldn’t tolerate other people at Xiao Chen’s side.

He directly grabbed Xiao Chen and held him in his arms, his head against the side of Xiao Chen’s neck, his voice hoarse and as pious as if praying to his own god.

“Everything will be as you wish.”

As long as you want it, no matter what it is, even if it is death, I will certainly do it for you.

Xiao Chen was stunned, and hugged the man’s waist with great strength, placing his hands on his back.

“My greatest wish.” Xiao Chen’s voice was a little choked, and a little bit moved. Unknowing what he recalled, his eyes flooded with tears, “Has always been for you to be by my side.”

The man rested his head against Xiao Chen’s neck, and finally pulled out a doting smile, rubbed Xiao Chen’s face with his chin, and kissed him.

His tone was soft and touched, “I know.”

I know everything.

Just like I know you love me.

“Captain, we recieved a phone report, someone found a female body wearing a blue skirt in the suburbs. According to the on-site forensic investigator, the age should be around 20 years old. She was a female student and seems to have been dead for two days.”

The male police officer listened to the voice on the phone and paused, especially when he heard the other party saying that it was a female student and wore a blue skirt.

His mind secretly had an outrageous idea.

He interrupted the other party and said anxiously, “Send me a picture of the body at the scene now.”

When the photo came in, the male police officer immediately widened his eyes, his pupils shrinking. It came as no surprise, felt within reason.

The corpse in the photo was completely stiff, with an ashen face, pale lips, and both eyes still open without shine. The whole body was covered in mud, lying on the ground in a twisted posture, and there was no trauma on the body. It looked very frightening.

It really was Li Yiwen, the missing murder suspect!

The male police officer gripped his cell phone.

How was this possible?

Li Yewen was missing for no more than 24 hours, how could the forensic investigator determine that she was dead for 2 days?

Thinking of this, the male police officer’s head could not help but recall and prod the face of the female student in the surveillance video.

At that time, the girl had her hair draped over, her head somewhat hanging, her shoulders raised up; her posture seemed completely strange. Her skin was so white that there was not even a bit of colour. Her stabbing motions were a little stiff, and her stride was jerky, like a robot without vital signs.

It looked like a moving corpse!

Thinking of this, the male police officer felt that his scalp was a little numb, and goose bumps stood up all over his body.

Fuck.

“Xiao Chen, when will you be back?” Zhou Keyu asked very carefully at the other end of the phone. Even the tone was a little strange, not knowing what was happening.

Xiao Chen repeatedly confirmed the owner of the voice, and paused while holding the mobile phone, inwardly feeling that it was very different from Zhou Keyu’s usual tone of voice.

“I’m already on my way back to school.” Xiao Chen replied patiently, while his other hand was held by the man, who was also deliberately scratching his palm with great delight.

Xiao Chen glared at the man, without the slightest bit of intimidation ability. In the latter’s eyes, the action was even very cute, like watching a calico pretend to be a tiger.

Xiao Chen could clearly sense the other party’s sigh of relief on the other end of the phone, who then continued to say cautiously, “Then pay attention to safety, be careful, watch the road, and come back early.”

Zhou Keyu paused, and said pompously, “We have something to discuss with you.”

Zhou Keyu obviously bit his mouth heavily on the word “we”, as if to emphasise this matter.

Xiao Chen was stunned for a moment, and then seemed to understand something, “Yes, I got it.”

As soon as Xiao Chen hung up the phone, the man took his mobile phone from his hand and then naturally stuck it in his back pocket.

Xiao Chen looked at his handling a little bit dumbfounded.

Gu Luming hmphed, a little tsundere, and then said, “Your time should entirely belong to me! You just ignored me for more than three minutes.”

As soon as the man finished speaking, Xiao Chen laughed. Xiao Chen held the other’s cheeks with both, rubbing and rolling them hard, and squeezing the two small pieces of flesh with all his strength, like a child playing with a beloved toy.

He even laughed while rubbing.

The man was not annoyed; he let the other play with him. Instead embraced the other’s waist and looked at him gently.

These two people had outstanding appearances, tall figures, and good-looking facial features. Just one of them walking in the crowd was the focus of attention, not to mention them walking together?

Along the way, it was unknown how many people were watching the two of them quietly from the corner of their eyes.

But the two of them kissed in all kinds of ways like no one else was around, pulling their little hands, embracing their waists, and showing a sweet smile when they looked at each other. Really wanting to let people see that they were a pair of sweethearts!

But Xiao Chen paid no mind, he always did as he pleased and didn’t care about everyone’s gaze.

The man, on the contrary, wanted the world to know that they were a pair.

After all......

The man silently lifted the corners of his mouth.

This was what he had been guarding for so many years. Even if someone accidentally harmed a strand of his hair, he would feel the pain, and he wish to destroy the world.

This was his, the love of his life.

The man crouched down, with his back to Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen was stunned.

The man saw through his thoughts and smiled, with a hint of teasing in it.

“I want to carry you.” But at the same time, it was so solemn.

Xiao Chen looked at the man’s profile without saying a word, and inexplicably his eyes somewhat stung and the rims of his eyes reddened.

Without saying anything, he directly threw himself on the man’s back, hooked his hands around the man’s neck, and kissed Gu Luming’s hair.

The man quickly clamped/tightened the others’ legs with his hands, and steadily carried the other behind him on his back, standing steadily.

“Do you remember, I used to want to carry you back then, and you would never let me no matter what.” The man seemed to think of something fun, and turned his head to look at Xiao Chen behind him.

Xiao Chen buried his head on the man’s neck, his face firmly against the other’s skin. After hearing the man’s words, some scenes flashed through his mind. He laughed, and in a muffled voice, “Of course I remember.”

But the Gu Luming at that time was really too short and small. When Xiao Chen heard the other party saying that he would carry him, he was shocked, and then refused without hesitation.

Gu Luming narrowed his eyes and smiled, “I swore at that time that I must grow taller and have a lot of muscles on my body; to easily carry you behind my back and protect you better.”

The man thought of this, and sighed a little regretfully, “It feels good to be carrying you like this.”

It was a pity that he waited too long to realise this wish.

By having this person on his back, he could easily smell the scent of the youth, feel the temperature of the other’s body, and hear the other’s heartbeat speeding up because of himself.

This kind of feeling was like having the whole world.

Wrong.

What he carried on his back, was the entire world.

Thinking of this, Gu Luming smiled again.

Xiao Chen’s lips pressed against Gu Luming’s ear. Biting the other’s earlobe, his lucky phoenix eyes curved, “I love you.”



“BOOM!”

Outside the window, thunder and lightning roared.

The seven people sheltered in boy’s dormitory 404 raised their heads all at once and looked out of the window, their faces frightened.

It should have been clear skies for miles when the sunny weather suddenly disappeared. At that moment thunder roared, and clouds suddenly covered everyone’s eyes like a huge black cloth.

Wang Qianqian, the most timid of the girls, and Wang Jiahao, the most timid of the boys, almost fell off their chairs, trembling and glancing at each other’s faces in dismay.

Zhang Hui unconsciously stood up and immediately reached out to turn the dorm lights on, but when he touched the light switch, his face changed. The lights in the room seemed to be malfunctioning, and he couldn’t turn it on no matter how much he flicked it.

The darkness at this very moment was clearly different from the usual darkness at night. It was so dark that you couldn’t see your own hand in front of you, which aroused the fear of the unknown in people’s hearts.

The four girls were cried out in fear, and they did not dare move. They could only rely on their voices to confirm the sisters around them, and then held each other.

Relying on his familiarity with the dormitory, Zhang Hui finally found his seat by tiptoeing and feeling the wall. He then skillfully opened his drawer and pulled out a flashlight.

He was overjoyed and pressed (the switch). But the flashlight did not turn on either.

Shit.

“BOOM.” There was another burst of thunder outside the window, claps of thunder and lightning constantly intertwined.

The girl who pinched Wang Qianqian before was called He Lei. She was so frightened that she staggered and almost sat down on the ground.

In that small room, there were many things and many people, and you couldn’t see around you clearly; it was crowded.

A flash of lightning illuminated the people’s faces, layers and layers of overlapping shadows. When it hit people’s eyes, they were like skeletons, the eyes could not be seen at all.

Not even mentioning the fact that everyone, because of their fear, all had stiff faces and no expressions, which made it even more terrifying.

He Lei swallowed, her teeth biting the flesh of her lower lip, and her eyes were filled with tears. Every time the thunder struck, she was so frightened that her whole body convulsed violently, as if she was shocked by electricity, her hair standing up.

Wang Qianqian was originally curled into a ball, sitting face-to-face with He Lei, the two were very close together.

A bolt of lightning flashed.

Wang Qianqian’s pupils shrunk suddenly, looking in front of her, her whole body immediately froze in place. Her expression was so horrified, it was like she had a heart attack. She opened his mouth, but it seemed as though her mouth was blocked by something, and she couldn’t make a sound.

With the light from the lightning, He Lei instantly noticed that something was wrong with Wang Qianqian’s expression; her eyes were clearly staring at something behind her. Her heart abruptly sank and her body stiffened.

Not knowing what she was thinking, She stiffened her neck and turned to the right, trying to see what was behind her.

In the midst of her turning, her face nearly touched another face. The face that was covered in blood, had mites growing all over it, and had so many bumps and holes it was nauseating.

The latter pulled a smile, hooking the corner of its mouth upward, and the bug on its face moved with it.

A lightning strike illuminated the face.

“AHHHHHH!” Wang Le suddenly jumped from the ground like a madman, stumbling over her own foot, stepped on something, and fell straight to the ground.

A “CRACK” rang out, the sound of a bone fracturing.

Wang Lei’s right elbow knocked the chair next to her, and her body hit the ground.

Wang Lei’s face wrinkled up, and she rolled on the ground with stabbing pain, screaming.

Now, because of Wang Lei’s racket, everyone’s heartbeat picked up, and the girls cried out even louder, even the boys collapsed from fright.

Fear permeated everyone’s heart.

Gu Luming steadily carried Xiao Chen the entire way. What’s more, it was a long distance from the hospital to the school. Xiao Chen even took the initiative and offered to order a ride, but the man flatly rejected it.

Gu Luming stubbornly carried Xiao Chen the entire way. It had been almost an hour since the journey started, but Gu Luming’s back was very stable and it didn’t seem like he was struggling.

Along the way, there were many people who looked at them with strange expressions. Xiao Chen obediently put his arms around the man’s neck, enjoying the treatment he should have experienced long ago.

The two were immersed in their emotions, and nothing around them could disturb them.

Especially when Gu Luming walked close to the school with Xiao Chen on his back. There were many students coming and going, and there were even more students who looked at the two with peculiar expressions.

Although Xiao Chen was low-key, he still was really handsome. It was a pity that he didn’t have the title of “school grass” because he had no intention of socialising and did not participate in school activities, but that didn’t mean that he had no fans.

Along the way, they met quite a few underclassmen who knew Xiao Chen. They were shocked to see this scene, and froze in place.

But the strange thing was that, when the handsome man walked slowly on the road, carrying the cold young man, the scene did not have a sense of disharmony. So much that the people seeing this scene were envious. After all, young people were quick to accept new things. The eyes looking at them were not only full of surprise, but also blessings.

“Am I heavy?” Xiao Chen raised his head and looked at the man’s forehead. There was no sweat on it.

The man’s right hand, which was originally holding the youth’s thigh, directly patted Xiao Chen’s rump.

Xiao Chen’s legs unconsciously clamped together.

The man was amused, and with a somewhat teasing tone, said with a smile, “What do you think?”

Xiao Chen lightly thought about it, and said truthfully, “Of course, heavy.”

The man heard the words and laughed again.

He was carrying his whole world on his back, could it not be heavy?

As soon as Gu Luming’s feet reached the vicinity of the dormitory, he couldn’t help but stop walkiing.

Xiao Chen’s head was plastered against the man’s neck. When he noticed his abnormality, he asked in a thin voice, “What’s wrong?”

Gu Luming lifted his head, looked up at the sky, and said nothing.

It was sunny, the sun was shining on them and it was warm; everything looked normal.

His eyes narrowed, and in the next second, his eyes saw through its outward appearance. On the other side of the mirror, lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, and dark energy flowed.

The man gently lowered Xiao Chen from his back, then grabbed the young man’s hand and interlocked their fingers.

Xiao Chen blinked uncertainly, and turned to look at the man’s face.

In the next second, the surrounding environment changed, and before Xiao Chen could calm down, it had completely dimmed.

The people who were just walking nearby had also disappeared

It was as if the two had arrived at a different world.

And Xiao Chen, who couldn’t see anything, unconsciously squeezed the man’s hand.

Gu Luming felt the youth’s nervousness, turned his head to look at Xiao Chen, then smiled dotingly.

His other hand slowly pressed down the young man’s shoulder, and Xiao Chen froze for a moment.

Gu Luming directly leaned over and placed a soft, wet kiss on his right eyelid, with a bit of intoxication and tenderness.

Immediately after, Xiao Chen’s eyes seemed to turn on like a light, and the originally unclear environment suddenly lit up.

He stood where he was, looking at the man’s grey eyes. Xiao Chen’s lips moved slightly.

The change in the man’s facial features was really too great, compared to before. They were solid and upright. Especially when looking at him, the love that involuntarily leaked out could truly drown someone.

Xiao Chen’s heartbeat immediately began to speed up, and both of them only had each other in their eyes.

It was just that this kind of visibility was different from the clear brightness of the daytime. His brain could clearly perceive that the surroundings were still dark, and could even feel the coldness around him, and it was a bit eerie.

“BOOM,” the lightning flashed and the thunder swelled.

The scene in front of him was exactly the same as the last time Xiao Chen saw a ghost.

“Where is this?” Xiao Chen asked.

The man narrowed his eyes, “This is the haunted domain of the ghost they summoned last time, also called the mirror world.”

The man knew that the youth didn’t understand, so he patiently explained, “Each ghost has its own ghost domain. It can simulate the surrounding environment and build a mirror world that is no different from reality. These ghosts capture those they want to take vengeance on into their own ghost domain, and then torture them a little bit.”

Xiao Chen nodded thoughtfully, then thinking of Zhang Hui and the others, suddenly tensed up, “Then they ...”

The man gripped Xiao Chen’s hand, knowing his concern, and said softly, “Let’s go.”

A group of seven people rushed out of the dormitory as if they were mad, walking quickly and in a panic, as if there was something dangerous behind them.

It was when they darted out of the room and rushed forward in the dark, relying on a flickering light, they suddenly realised that there was no one around!

As if they were walking through the maze, no matter how hard they sprinted, they were still running in the corridors, unable to see the stairway!

As Zhou Keyu ran forward, he kept an eye out, counting the numbers of the surrounding dorm rooms. When he approached the dormitory next to the stairs, his heart thumped.

Because they had once again returned to the door of Dorm 404!

“I don’t want to die! I’m still young! I don’t want to die!” He Lei’s expression was a little crazy. Her arm had been twisted to the point that it looked almost broken, blood oozing out.

Her facial features were twisted, mixed with unbearable pain and the fear of death, her two eyes were so wide open, they seemed to almost pop out.

She was crying and shouting, her body twitching uncontrollably, her mental state swimming on the verge of collapse.

The ghost seemed to show a special preference for He Lei, and revealing itself in flashes in front of her eyes, wearing a sinister smile.

He Lei went completely crazy. With her uninjured hand, she grabbed Wu Tianmei, who was the shortest and weakest of the girls. With the shocked expression on the girl’s face, she grabbed her by the collar and dragged her towards the ghost.

Dragging her while crying out, “Kill her, don’t hurt me!!”

Wu Tianmei was thrown to the ground with a “BANG” and raised her head. Her pupils constricted violently.

The white ghost smiled at her, her bloody mouth wide open like a sacrificial bowl. She could see that her face was covered with scars, and that the insects on the ghost’s face slowly crawled out of the right side of her face, and then burrowed into the uneven holes on the left of her face, which was extremely disgusting.

“Ah ah ah ah ah ah -” Wu Tianmei was so scared that she rolled on the ground hurriedly. Zhang Hui, who was beside her, had quick eyes and hands, took advantage of the situation and pulled her up.

As for the expressions of the boys and girls looking at He Lei, they instantly felt a bitterly disappointed and angry.

The ghost seemed to have had enough teasing, and rushed up again, grabbing Zhou Keyu’s chin and directly strangling him.

Out of instinct, Zhou Keyu went crazy and kicked at the body of the white ghost. Both hands kept pulling at the hands gripping his throat, and he almost lost all his breath.

But his strong desire to survive made him still struggle wildly, even though his face was flushed.

After all, he really didn’t want to die.

Wang Jiahao on the sidelines was obviously the one with the least courage, but although he didn’t know what was going on, he mustered up his courage and rushed forward. He grabbed the hands strangling Zhou Keyu’s neck, trying to help him break free from the shackles of the white ghost.

Naturally! This was all in vain.

At this moment, the surrounding scene was extremely chaotic. The girls were so frightened that their legs went limp, wailing endlessly. He Lei huddled in the corner and rubbed her face against the wall like a madwoman, shouting, “Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!”

Zhang Hui was still working hard to contain Wu Tianmei’s emotions, and the situation was unending.

Everyone’s heart was in despair and collapsing.

For a moment, everyone had the same thought.

It’s over, they will die!

All of a sudden, the white clad ghost, who was flaunting her claws, released his grip on Zhou Keyu, letting out a shrill scream.

His cry was like a criminal being hacked to pieces, a bit hoarse and tragic. What was even more terrifying was that his face was twisted.

The face full of disgusting things was wrinkled up, the worms wriggling around.

Zhou Keyu was thrown to the ground and began coughing crazily, and Wang Jiahao’s condition was not much better. The two watched the frantic movement of the white ghost in horror.

Finally, everyone noticed the two people standing behind the ghost in white.

“BOOM.” There was another loud noise.

Illuminated by the flash of lightning, the seven frightened people finally saw the face of one of them...

It was Xiao Chen.



The scene in front of them was extremely chaotic; Lying down and crying, everyone looked like they were on the verge of falling apart, with snot and tears all over their faces.

The ghost in white looked much more terrifying than what Xiao Chen saw before. It suffices to say, if the two of them had come one step later, the people in front of them would certainly be dead.

Xiao Chen opened his mouth, feeling complicated, with an indescribable sadness in his heart.

Gu Luming watched all this with cold eyes, and in the next second, diamond-shaped tool shaped like an awl were conjured out of thin air.

After letting go of Xiao Chen’s hand, he immediately teleported to stand behind the white-ghost, so quickly and quietly that no one had time to react.

The man’s face was cold, and with a fierce flash in his eyes, he stabbed the knife into the white ghost’s back without hesitation.

A brief crack appeared in the white ghost’s expression, and something green oozed out of the wound.

This was no ordinary weapon.

The moment the white ghost was stabbed, he loosened his restraint of Zhou Keyu because of the severe pain. With a ferocity beyond description, the shrill cry almost broke through the walls.

This cry sent chills down the spine of everyone present, as if a thousand bugs were scratching in their ears.

The white-clothed ghost’s body paused because of the pain. In the next second, her body turned 180 degrees, her face became extremely twisted. She stared at the man who stabbed her while she was off-guard with her white eyes.

The female ghost’s face was nauseatingly ugly. Her eyes rolled slyly, and they met the man’s cold eyes.

The man’s mouth curled upwards, and he quickly pulled the knife out of the white ghost’s waist with great speed.

The white ghost’s screams grew more horrific, and more and more green pus flowed from her waist.

And in a corner where no one could see, Gu Luming’s palms gathered a mass of black qi, directly aiming to attack the female ghost’s injured waist.

The female ghost, with a face full of rage due to her injuries, had a brief blank expression at the moment of the yīn qì gathered, which then turned into horror. As if realising something, she began to struggle crazily, trying to escape from the man’s confinement.

As for the seven people standing behind them, the girls had already covered her eyes, and the boys’ hearts sank suddenly, with fear on their faces.

From their point of view, what they could see was that the ghost in white suddenly went berserk, and the man stood quietly without any movement.

They could almost imagine that in the next second, the man in front of him would be torn to bits by the ghost, a blood splattered scene.

No matter how much the ghost in white struggled, everything she did was in vain.

It gritted its teeth, not knowing whether to welcome death home, still holding on to the mentality that even if it died, it would drag someone down to hell with him. Its bloody skull-like eye turned left and right, and immediately locked on to Xiao Chen standing behind the man.

It showed a chilling smile, stretching its arms out. It began to transform freely, its sharp claws were about to pierce the youth’s skin.

But before the female ghost’s hand actually touched the young man, the man’s gloomy face suddenly became terrifying, even more sinister. The corners of his mouth twitched slightly for a moment, and his body began to emit yīn qì all over.

For some unknown reason, even the lightning and thunder that continuously flared and raged in the sky disappeared without a trace.

It was as if the frightened eyes of the seven people were covered by a black cloth, there was only darkness. They could not see the surrounding scene at all, nor did they know the struggle between the man and the white ghost.

Gu Luming looked like he was insane. His grey eyes were bloodshot, and inexplicably, two streams of red blood began to flow out of his eyes.

He cut off the white-clothed ghost’s hand that wanted to hurt the young man, and then let out a sneer, like a condemnation from hell. In the next second, he transformed into a cloud of black mist and began to mercilessly attack the white-clothed ghost.

Looking at the scene in front of him, Xiao Chen froze in place, at a loss.

The people around could only hear the frightening screams of the ghost in white, but they couldn’t see the scene clearly.

Their hearts were all curious and yet full of fear.

Xiao Chen was frightened, his eyes fixed on the white and black shadows fighting in front of him. He burned with anxiety, fearing that the man would be injured and would be at a disadvantage.

He would rather die by himself than go through losing Gu Luming again.

It was the kind of pain that was more difficult than dying. He finally got him back, and he couldn’t lose him a second time.

Every attack by the black shadow skillfully stabbed the fatal points of the white-clothed ghost, making it impossible for her to hide or escape.

The white ghost’s yīn qì also began to dissipate little by little, so much so that her body couldn’t sustain its shape.

The black shadow smiled darkly, and under the horrified gaze of the white ghost, opened his mouth like a giant toad and swallowed the other person into his stomach in one bite, chewing carefully.

After the black shadow devoured the white-clothed ghost, he stood still and burped with a full stomach. Suddenly, he seemed to realize something, his whole body freezing. He then nervously turned his head to look at Xiao Chen behind him, who was staring at him with burning eyes.

He had just forgotten that Xiao Chen could now clearly see his current appearance.

The black shadow couldn’t help but panic.

Was he ugly like this?

He had just devoured the white-clothed ghost, did that scene scare him?

The more he thought about it, the more embarrassed he was. The shadow felt a bit uneasy, and even froze in place, not daring to to move. He even forgot to change back to human form.

Seeing that he was not injured, Xiao Chen breathed a sigh of relief.

Without hesitation, he stepped forward and walked up to the man, calmly staring at this dark face with its unseen facial features.

The black shadow finally reacted, and returned to human form again in the next second. He wrapped his arms around Xiao Chen’s waist in a panic and held him in his arms.

Xiao Chen touched the hair on his head with his hand, and just like coaxing a frightened child, he patted it gently.

“Well done!”

The man breathed a slight sigh of relief.

The people at the side who couldn’t see anything realised that the sound had stopped, and felt a burst of distress.

Before they could react, the weather around them unexpectedly brightened. What was even more incredible was that the people who were still breathing in the corridor shockingly found that they were still in Dorm 404, and had never left at all. It was as if everything they had just experienced was just a pipe dream.

And the only face showed malevolence, the only one who still weeped endlessly was He Lei, who remained with a fractured arm.

Everyone looked at her with a disdain.

Selfish.

After what she had done, it was kindness not to give her both fists and kick with both feet.

No matter how she begged for help from the sidelines, the bitterly disappointed people were all unwilling to help her.

Zhou Keyu came to his senses, looked around in disbelief, and finally locked his eyes on the strange man and Xiao Chen who appeared from nowhere.

Xiao Chen and the man are hugging together in an extremely friendly manner, that even a steel straight man like Zhou Keyu could see -with some hindsight- that the two in front of him seem to be a pair.

“Xiao Chen!” Zhang Hui shouted in shock, his eyes brimming with doubts.

It was unknown whether he was in shock because of the lingering alarm of seeing a ghost before, or because he saw Xiao Chen being very intimate with a man.

Xiao Chen let go of the man, easily capturing his five fingers without shying away. He looked up at the man’s smiling eyes, and then said frankly, “This is my boyfriend, his name is Gu Luming, he was the one who saved you just now.”

Zhou Keyu and Wang Jiahao were still lying on the ground, they stood up with some difficulty. The strangle marks on Zhou Keyu’s neck had not disappeared, and his heart was still pounding non-stop because of what had happened.

Looking at the mess around them, everyone could clearly perceive that what happened before was real, and not a dream.

The girls, because they had gotten another chance to live, cried even harder and hugged each other. They didn’t know whether they were more happy or more terrified after the fright they went through.

Zhou Keyu directly grasped the key point of the matter, gritted his teeth and asked eagerly, “Will that ghost continue to haunt us?”

That was also something everyone wanted to know.

Was that white ghost scared away temporarily or would it never come again?

The man laughed with disdain, but most of it was cold, killing intent.

Thi killing intent was not aimed at Zhou Keyu, but it made the latter shudder startle slightly.

There grew an indescribable fear, more than the horror from seeing a female ghost before.

Knowing the whole process, Xiao Chen helped the man by answering directly, “She will not bother you again.”

Everyone breathed a slight sigh of relief.

Wang Jiahao, who had been staring at the man’s face in a daze, cried out in belated realisation and exclaimed, “You’re Gu Luming?”

His exclamation not only attracted the attention of the man and Xiao Chen, but also made everyone present look at him.

Even Xiao Chen was a little surprised.

But Wang Jiahao shoved Zhou Keyu violently and explained in a hurry, “Did you forget? The last time we dragged Xiao Chen to drink. Who would have thought Xiao Chen would pour a single cup and still get absolutely wasted? And he would keep shouting loudly on the main road all by himself, and the name he kept shouting was Gu Luming, ah, no, you remember it yourself. ”

Wang Jiahao’s explanation roused the memories of Zhou Keyu and Zhang Hui. The two glanced at each other and nodded.

And their dialogue also succeeded in making Xiao Chen’s face burn to the colour of a crayfish.

He even scratched his palm in embarrassment.

The man’s eyelids twitched. His eyes, originally full of coldness because of the white-clothed ghost, slowly softened. He stared at Xiao Chen, whose face was completely red.

Actually, he remembered it as well.

It was still summer, and he could only follow Xiao Chen secretly in the form of a shadow.

That day Xiao Chen had gotten drunk, his face flushed deep red. He was undoubtedly an extremely sensible person, but on the main road, he cried loudly without the slightest regard for his appearance, and frantically called out his name.

The group of people in the dormitory used the strength of nine bulls and two tigers to wrangle him back to the dormitory, and then threw him on the bed. In that half-drowsy and half-asleep state, tears still flowed furiously, and his expression was so full of suffering that he wished he could beat himself to death.

Before that, he’d even thought that Xiao Chen had already come out of those shadows and had long forgotten him.

Although he was unwilling, he hoped that Xiao Chen would live well if he could.

But on that day, he finally realised that this person in front of him, the one he had loved deeply for so many years, had been hiding away the memories of the two of them deep down, all this time. Never had forgotten, nor will ever forget.

It was masochistic, not daring to forget, constantly thinking about it, so much that it was torturing himself.

Thinking of it, the man gripped Xiao Chen’s hand tightly.

It was at that time that he finally realised that their hearts had always been connected.

This whole ridiculous play had a happy ending.

But Zhou Keyu, from beginning to end, didn’t smile a bit, nor was he complacent because he survived.

They did survive, but their friends Chen Liu and Yuan Daqiang really died.

This pain was a sin that he cannot redeem in his life.

That night, Xiao Chen did not return to the dorm.

Instead, with the man’s help, he rented a room outside the school and arranged it into a small love nest for the two of them.

Xiao Chen softly rested in the man’s arms. The man rested one hand on his waist, and made the other a pillow for Xiao Chen to rest against, while easily holding a bowl of fruit.

The young man held the book in his hands, carefully reading its content. Like before, he thought of reading this story to the man, like coaxing a child who refused to sleep.

The man turned his head and kissed beneath the young man’s ears, nibbling quietly.

Xiao Chen, who was so absorbed in reading the book, became agitated and could no longer completely concentrate on its content.

He flung his head to the side and tried to glare at the man, but the other caught him, closing the gap and kissed him.

Xiao Chen gently pushed against the man, trying to break free.

Instead, the hands shackling his waist tightened further and even started to move naughtily.

By the time Xiao Chen came to his senses, his book had already been thrown on the floor, and the man had pressed him down.

The two were like eggs that had been peeled of their shells, they trusted each other fully.

Xiao Chen had always been seen as a frigid person, and he knew little about this subject.

He had thought that the most two men could do together was kiss and hug each other to ease their desires, so after struggling a bit, he let the man touch him.

When the man really did something he shouldn’t have, Xiao Chen’s face finally changed. He trembled with fear, and asked, panicked, “Are you sure it’s like this?”

Xiao Chen was really afraid of pain.

The man naturally knew what the other was afraid of, smiled, and said softly, “Just leave everything to me.”

Finishing his words, the man sealed Xiao Chen’s mouth with his, and sunk into pleasure together.

The youth also slowly began to accept the initial discomfort and pain. Altogether, he enjoyed it.

For a long time, everything was silent.

“Baby, I really really, love you so much.” Xiao Chen was dazed and heard someone talking to him. The voice was soft and quiet, but indescribably reassuring.

Xiao Chen moved, his voice a bit choked up and tired, “Me too.”

Gentle laughter, indulgent and loving, filled the air.



The lazy sunlight shone through the glass and into the room, scattering into small rays of light, and mottled stars were reflected on the glossy floor.

The young man shrank under the quilt. It covered his head, and only a few locks of hairs could be seen.

Like a silkworm, he wriggled around.

After an unknown period of time, perhaps because it was hard to breathe, Xiao Chen finally peeked out his head.

His bleary eyes slowly opened, looked around, then stretched out.

His collarbone and chest was littered with red marks, all different sizes and depths of kiss marks could be plainly seen.

The sun shining on him, Xiao Chen reluctantly turned over in the quilt; his belly stuck to the bed, only his hands were propping him up. With a tired face, he then buried his head in his pillow.

This posture made the line of his butterfly bone stick out. Although he was skinny, he was pale and mouthwateringly beautiful. It made people want to place a few red marks on that place. In reality, someone already had.

Xiao Chen was dizzy and lightheaded, and it felt like he was about to collapse. He didn’t know whether it was because he slept too long or because he was tossed around too hard by that man last night.

Just as he was sneakily rebuking him in his head, the door of the room opened with a click.

As soon as the man came in, he directly threw himself on the young man, and even through the quilt, Xiao Chen could feel the other person was in heat.

Not only that, but he also felt a firm pressure on his back..

The man propped himself up to leave a gap for Xiao Chen, so that the youth had enough space to turn over easily.

Xiao Chen was too lazy to move, giving him a sideways glance, and kept his eyes half closed.

Gu Luming looked thoughtfully at Xiao Chen’s half-exposed skin, which was covered in his “hard work”.

And he also clearly knew that at this moment, Xiao Chen was naked under the quilt, without any clothes on.

The man pressed his head against Xiao Chen’s butterfly bone, daring not to force it, but it was enough to touch the other person’s skin.

His lips caressed Xiao Chen’s back, and then moved down. Using his chin to pull the quilt straight downwards, until it reached his waistline.

The tattoo on his back was completely exposed to the sun.

Gu Luming’s lips ticked upwards, and he pressed his lips against it.

This was his favourite place.

There is something greatly alluring about it for him.

He had tossed him around too cruelly yesterday, and the youth’s body could not bear being done like that for now, so he just wanted to kiss to satisfy himself.

But the man’s presence was too strong, and Xiao Chen was also very sleepy. He repeatedly wandered back and forth between sleep and wakefulness.

The young man couldn’t help himself and turned over, facing the man squarely and meeting the other’s grey eyes.

What great luck. Xiao Chen was almost taken aback by the undisguised possessiveness and satisfaction in the man’s eyes.

This was the moment when his brain immediately snapped awake. Realising that he wasn’t wearing any clothes, and that his body was full of the marks left by the other party’s “hard work” last night.

With a pang of irritation and a bit of shyness, Xiao Chen immediately grabbed the quilt and pulled it over his head.

The entirety of last night was simply ridiculous.

The man chuckled.

After hesitating for a long time, Xiao Chen slowly stuck out half of his head, exposing his bewitching phoenix eyes.

The man’s oppressiveness was powerful. Pressed against him, he clearly felt the other’s aggressive territoriality while being completely enveloped in his arms.

Xiao Chen’s face became apple red again.

Xiao Chen’s mouth was muffled in the quilt, and plus the excessive use of throat last night, his voice was hoarse and sulky, very soft, “Get away from me.”

It didn’t sound like an order, but as if he was acting spoiled to get the man closer to him.

The man simply stopped propping himself up and directly pressed his entire body onto Xiao Chen, his head tucked against the side of the youth’s neck. It was so heavy that no matter how Xiao Chen moved or pushed in the quilt, he couldn’t push this heavy weight off of him.

The two were in a deadlock.

Xiao Chen said innocently, “I’m hungry.”

The man climbed off him.

However, while dressing, the man still took advantage of him, restraining him in his arms the entire time, and personally dressing Xiao Chen, piece by piece.

The movements were very slow, and a little perverted/sexual. Xiao Chen didn’t know how many times he glared at him throughout the process.

Finally, after a long delay, Xiao Chen was dressed and tidied up. On the contrary, Gu Luming, who had been dressed quite neatly, had all kinds of creases on his clothes, which didn’t look sophisticated at all.

After Xiao Chen quickly washed up, he found that the man had busied himself with a table of dishes. He didn’t know whether it was made while he went to sleep after being done repeatedly.

The dishes were varied, but all were of light and soup variety.

Probably because the youth had his first time last night, and it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to eat anything too greasy or heavy the next day.

When Xiao Chen came out of the bathroom, the man was cutting fruit on the kitchen chopping board.

The sunlight passed through the glass window at the top of the kitchen and directly hit the man’s face, casting a soft light on it, as if in a dream.

Xiao Chen walked straight forward and put his arms around the man’s waist, leaning his head on the man’s neck, looking closely at the man’s every move.

Gu Luming hid that this posture made it awkward to move and hindered his movement, and let Xiao Chen hug him tightly.

After he had finished cutting, Xiao Chen reluctantly let him go.

The man was a ghost, he didn’t need to eat at all. The whole time, Xiao Chen ate carefully by himself, the man sitting opposite him, watching with a smile on his face as his cheeks puffed up, and swallowed.

It was peaceful the entire time, no one said anything, but no one felt awkward about it either. Even if there was only the sound of food chewing in the air, it lent to the gentle and quiet feeling.

Xiao Chen yawned, still a little sleepy.

The man stood up silently to clear away the dishes, and quietly washed them. He then wrapped the leftovers in plastic and placed them in the fridge.

Xiao Chen looked at his busy back, and his mouth could not help but smile, his eyes narrowing.

This kind of life was exactly the same as those he had once dreamed of.

Two people living in the same house, with easy and simple wealth, eating rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea, and then living a lifetime together, healthy and carefree, happy on their own.

Yawning, Xiao Chen couldn’t help but walk to the sofa next to him, and collapsed limply onto it. Within a few minutes, he completely dozed off.

Gu Luming walked out, sighed, wiped his hands with a towel, then took out the blanket from the room and carefully covered Xiao Chen’s body.

He didn’t want him to catch a cold.

The man picked him up with his big hands and sat at the end of the sofa, resting the youth’s head on his lap, giving him a free human pillow.

Xiao Chen moved, uncomfortable, then shifted to a better position, and fell asleep again.

It seems that being tossed around really tired him out.

The man couldn’t help but think this.

Gu Luming lowered his head and looked at Xiao Chen’s sleepy face, lost in thought.

“This is the new transfer student, his name is Xiao Chen. I hope everyone will get along well in the future.” The class teacher looked at the students chattering incessantly under the podium, and her head ached. She turned and wrote Xiao Chen’s name in big letters on the blackboard.

The class teacher looked at the reticent Xiao Chen. After being notified by the school, she knew that the child’s life was a bit pitiful, and that he looked unapproachable.

The students in the audience discussed excitedly amongst themselves.

They were at that age, the age where you were curious about anything novel.

A gloomy and dark boy, with bangs covering his eyes, sat at the back of the classroom. He was drawing in a sketchbook, as if he were separated from the world, and no one could enter his eyes.

“Xiao Chen, find a seat for the afternoon.” The female teacher smiled gently at Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen turned and walked off the stage in silence, clearly hearing the assessing remarks spoken around him.

“Oh, he is so handsome!”

“His face is so pale too!!”

“Tch! He’s just a pretty boy, look at the aesthetics of these school girls.”

Xiao Chen didn’t say a word the whole time, and simply looked around the room.

There were not many vacant seats in the classroom.

After hesitating again and again, Xiao Chen’s eyes locked on the boy sitting at the back of the class, who hadn’t raised his head the entire time.

There was an empty seat next to him.

Then without hesitation, he walked over.

Although he would have a strange deskmate, it seemed that it would be quiet here.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Xiao Chen placed his schoolbag on the table. The loud sound instantly disturbed the freak drawing.

He raised his head, bangs blocking his eyes, but he could still see the person in front of him clearly.

Pale and slender, and even against the light, he could tell that the person in front of him was very good looking.

The boy felt something stabbing his heart, it gently tingled, but it didn’t hurt.

Xiao Chen sat down on the chair and took out his books, like a porcelain doll, soulless.

After everyone had withdrawn their gazes because the teacher was about to start the class, the freak remained unblinking, staring closely at the person beside him.

Love at first glance, a reluctant goodbye; the days stretch out ahead of us.

Later on afterwards.

“Don’t you have any friends?”

“...”

“That’s alright, I don’t have any either, so let’s both be good friends.”

“...”

Gu Luming pulled himself out from his memories and continued to stare at Xiao Chen’s face in a daze. He smiled gently and, just like Xiao Chen had done countless times before, opened his mouth and began to recite love poems.

“I am a venomous snake in the deep ditch. Forsaken by light, deserving of scorn and loathing.”

“But although I am like this, I fell in love with you, who was more dazzling than roses.”

“But you, I had later learned, were an abandoned rose.”

“Thus I longed to pull you into the abyss, to indulge in it with me.”

“But in the end.”

“It was you who saved me from the darkness.”

Unforgettable.


Arc 7 Old Spirit Manor

“Hey, Xiao Chen! Hurry up! Why are you so slow?”

Walking in front, a silver-haired boy donned with earrings and makeup was holding his phone, looking towards the city behind.

At this moment, the six of the seven group members all looked at the boy who was walking slowly at the end.

It wasn’t like the boy wanted to walk this slow, but he was carrying the most things in his hands, while the other six were all traveling lightly, at most carrying a backpack on their backs. Nevertheless if it were a boy or a girl, they all wore beautiful clothes and delicate makeup, each holding a selfie stick in their hand and posing in all kinds of different ways.

They weren’t like him, with a bag on his back, another one hanging on his neck, and both his hands holding two bags each.

What’s strange was that he wasn’t like the other people who were very eye-catching, instead covering his face with a mask, only showing a pair of eyes, as if he didn’t want people to see his facial features.

“Hello dear fans, I’m your little fairy Annie, long time no see.” The girl with luscious golden waves wore suspenders and shorts, pointed the lens of her phone at herself flatteringly, and started to broadcast live.

[ Mr. Clown: They’re here! Are you going to live broadcast in another haunted place today?

Sailor Moon: Hee hee, today’s little Annie is still super beautiful!

Shou Shou Shou: Wow! Goddess, here I come! I never thought I would come this early today!

Lavender Field: The death squad has once again started their death-seeking journey! Hahaha, where are you going today? ]

Annie looked at the comments that flashed across the screen, placed the phone in a position where her face seemed the smallest, and continued. “Today, our daring little death squad will go to the old spirit manor that circled the internet wildly before.”

As soon as those words came out, the live broadcast room seemingly exploded.

[ The Little Cutie Is Me: Oh my god! Goddess, have you guys gone crazy?

Phoenix Prisoner: ??? Did I hear wrong or did you say it wrong? ]

Looking at the explosive live broadcast room and the rising number of fans, she smiled. “In this world there are only places where our death squad haven’t found a time to go, never a place we dare not to go.”

After a pause, she gave a flowery smile and said: “For the sake of our sincerity, dear fans, don’t forget to swipe some gifts oh~!”

Xiao Chen walked at the end of the line carrying many heavy objects, observing his surroundings calmly.

He had just woken up from this body a few hours ago.

Thinking of his lover, Xiao Chen couldn’t help rubbing his forehead.

At that time, only after he and Jing Hezhi left those small worlds, did he realize that the many worlds they experienced were nothing more than just movie worlds.

As for him and Jing Hezhi, one is mutated movie data, and the other is a virus capable of destroying the world.

After they left that world, they directly entered a place similar to a transfer station, and found that in this world, there were hundreds of thousands of different small worlds.

It’s possible that Jing Hezhi was too bored, said that he was going to spend his honeymoon in these small worlds, and then after much consideration sent him to the movie world of “Locust Tree Spirit Manor”.

The Huai character brings ghosts, so as its name suggests, it is a horror film.

Six internet celebrities who aren’t afraid of death, plus a miscellaneous assistant, form this little death squad.

The seven of them, adhering to the motto of never troubling trouble till trouble troubles you , came to this old internet-viral locust tree manor for a live broadcast. Then, they were tortured by the ghosts. With the whole squad wiped out, the movie came to an end.

Coincidentally, the character Xiao Chen transmigrated into was the body of the miscellaneous assistant in charge of doing chores.

He sighed, and continued to follow the group while carrying the pile of heavy objects.

The old locust tree manor was located in a remote location, not in the suburbs of any city, but in a remote mountain of a rural area. Xiao Chen really couldn’t think of what these people want to achieve, coming to such a poor place after traveling thousands of miles.

The mountain road was uneven and the traveling route was quite far, in the end they also lost their lives.

Xiao Chen carried the heavy objects all the way up, his forehead oozing sweat.

Zhao Junlu walked in front of Xiao Chen, talking to his fans non-stop. To be precise, except for Xiao Chen, the other six people were all chatting with their fans.

Zhao Junlu flicked his newly permed silver hair, showing a domineering and charming smile.

[ Red High-Heeled Shoes: The little assistant in the back looks so tired! Carrying so many things!

Mother Kangaroo: I feel like this little assistant is a handsome guy. I watched up close during the live broadcast before, his eyes are that kind of piercing phoenix eyes , really pretty!

Morning Glory: Junlu, shouldn’t you go help him carry some things? He seems to be working very hard.

Thorn Of The Rose: I really want to know what he looks like under that mask! Can he take it off?

Towel: Curious +1 ]

Zhao Junlu frowned when he saw that his chat screen was inexplicably bombarded with comments about the little assistant, feeling quite uncomfortable.

Especially with more and more comments about Xiao Chen’s face, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of crisis.

He had secretly seen Xiao Chen’s face before. Truth be told, with all of the internet celebrities present here, even after wearing makeup, they might not look half as delicate as the plain-faced Xiao Chen.

It’s estimated that except for himself, the other five people have not seen Xiao Chen’s face behind the mask.

He remembered that when he accidentally caught a glimpse, he felt the anger of being deceived by a scum girl, because they all thought Xiao Chen was ugly, but in reality he had a face value higher than any internet celebrity.

But what could he do?

As soon as Xiao Chen’s mask falls, all their fans in the live broadcasting room might become Xiao Chen’s licking dogs ; then how should he act?

In the end, in order to maintain his charismatic persona, and for Xiao Chen to not get any more of his fans’ attention, Zhao Junlu showed a fan-favorite smile and hinted, “Xiao Chen’s face, en….”

In a low voice, he continued, “He doesn’t really like people to talk about his face, anyway, there’s no need to ask.” As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately added, “But he is really hardworking, so I’ll go and help him.”

After he finished speaking, he directly went to Xiao Chen’s side and said, “Here, Xiao Chen, I’ll help you carry some things.”

He said some, and it really was just some.

Zhao Junlu took away the camera, glanced at the things that Xiao Chen was carrying, then with his back turned to the camera revealed a disgusted expression. Reluctantly, he used an orchid finger pose to take off the lightest, smallest bag from the top of Xiao Chen’s head, the kind that didn’t weigh much at all.

Turning his head, he continued the live broadcast, “Ok, let’s keep going.”

The fans in the live broadcast room immediately started showering him with praise and gifts from all sides.

They all acquiesced to the fact that behind Xiao Chen’s mask was a hideous face.

Zhao Junlu smiled happily, intentionally adjusting the camera to an angle where his fans couldn’t see Xiao Chen, then continued live broadcasting.

Xiao Chen watched this showman’s contrived performance, and without any light luggage on him, he heavily sighed.

Meanwhile, Du Chonghua, who was in charge of looking at the map and leading the way at the front, slightly frowned. Clearly they were walking with the guidance of the mobile phone map, but they were getting farther and farther away from the Old Locust Tree Manor’s location.

The forks on the path were increasing more and more, it was completely impossible to figure out which direction to go.

What kind of situation was this?

Just when Du Chonghua was getting confused to the point of silently cursing, it was unknown what he saw, but his eyes suddenly lit up.

It was an old woman who seemed to be in her sixties or seventies, holding her cane and slowly walking towards the direction of their group.

She was definitely a local! Ask her and she’ll definitely know the way!

With this line of thinking, Du Chonghua took big steps and directly strided over. “Old lady, do you know which way is the path to Old Locust Tree Manor?”

Only when Du Chonghua walked over did he realize that the old lady had an inexplicably appalling face.

Her jawline was very high, with a hunched back that seemed really similar to the two lumps on a camel’s back . Her whole figure appeared to be deformed, and her fully wrinkled face looked like the bark of a big tree that was about to die, seeming very weird.

Of course, what made Du Chonghua unable to breathe was definitely this lady’s feet, with the size of a three-inch golden lotus . Wearing leather shoes that were a size similar to baby shoes, her walking posture was extremely distorted.

This was a woman with unusually small feet.

The old woman raised her head slowly, pointed in one direction with her cane, motioning for them to continue walking in that direction.

Only when the old woman was about two meters away from him, did Du Chonghua breathe a sigh of relief.

Realizing that the attention of the fans in the live broadcasting room were all on that old woman, he immediately pointed the camera over there.

[ Green Channel: Why do I get goosebumps just by looking at this old woman?

Pink Lady: Upstairs +1

36k Chunshuai: Damn, her feet are so small, she’s also walking so strangely; looks so deformed ah. This is my first time seeing a small footed woman similar to the ones written in books. ]

The rest of the group terribly disliked the old woman. Looking at that kind of face, it kept giving off the feeling that she exuded a bodily stench and didn’t like cleanliness.

If it wasn’t for the live broadcast, they might’ve even said some insulting words.

When the old woman passed by Xiao Chen, she paused, her nearly white eyes meeting Xiao Chen’s.

No words were spoken, but Xiao Chen could confirm that the old woman gave him an extremely friendly, gentle smile. Although the smile was slightly distorted and weird, he, who had long been numbed by encountering ghosts for so long, saw that there were some points of kindness in her eyes.

Xiao Chen remembered this elder.

In the movie, it was also when the death squad was lost did she pop up, pointing out the way for the group. From then after, the group soon walked into the deep mountains where the Old Locust Tree Manor was located.

This little death squad really didn’t use their brains to think; an old woman appearing in the wilderness didn’t stir up any doubts.

However, in the original plot, when the old woman appeared, it was already dark.

It was too coincidental to appear now.

Looking at her smile, Xiao Chen couldn’t help but mutter in his heart.

The old woman stared into Xiao Chen’s eyes, as if wanting to see something. The next second, while everyone wasn’t paying attention, she gently drew some strange symbols on the ground next to Xiao Chen’s feet with her cane, then calmly continued on her way.

“……”

Xiao Chen didn’t speak a word as he looked at her leaving silhouette.

He could feel that after the old woman finished drawing, everything he carried on him seemed to lose weight all of a sudden. Not only did he stop feeling any pressure weighing down, but he also felt his whole body relax.

Xiao Chen felt his head ache.

According to his nature, even without thinking, in this world, his old Gong would probably be some kind of fierce ghost, and he may even be the big BOSS of the Old Locust Tree Manor.

The old woman anxiously thought that his old Gong felt heartache seeing him too tired carrying things, and specially sended her to come over and lead the way while also helping him reduce the weight of the items he’s carrying.

Thinking to this point, Xiao Chen didn’t know whether to cry or laugh.



With the old woman’s guidance, Du Chonghua continued to lead the team, occasionally looking at the map on his phone.

Because of the bumpy mountain road and the various sized mud pits on the ground, it was practically impossible to drive. The group had walked for over an hour now.

They were originally all pampered internet celebrities, the kind who have never suffered much. After only walking a bit, they were already panting, utterly miserable.

Finally, the luscious golden waved Annie couldn’t bear it anymore, and complained, “Let’s take a break! My legs hurt so much!”

The girl with long, straight black hair beside her also nodded, took a deep breath, and echoed, “I’m tired too.”

Du Chonghua could be considered as the captain of this team, the core figure of the whole squad; Basically, everyone obeyed his arrangements, so they all glanced at him at this moment.

Du Chonghua frowned, feeling unhappy in his heart, especially when he felt like it was getting dark, and the trip was still reaching far into the indefinite future , making him feel an increased amount of dissatisfaction.

However, he was donning the persona of a caring older brother, so in order not to collapse his character, Du Chonghua suppressed his temper and said in a muffled and cold voice, “Then let’s take a ten-minute break first.”

As soon as his voice fell, Annie, the straight black haired girl named Su Lele, and Wang Xueke who was dressed in a JK uniform , all immediately held their phones and started excitedly snapping photos of themselves with the background scenery.

Together, they posed in various ways, interacting with their audience in a frail and contrived manner, displaying just how difficult it’s been for them.

“Xiao Chen,” Du Chonghua called towards the back of the group, “give me a bottle of water.”

This assistant was hired by him, mainly because they had too much luggage for the trip, and needed someone to carry them. They also needed someone to do the physical labor, and be the first to charge in dangerous situations.

In the end, he was just a tool man.

Du Chonghua had never seen Xiao Chen’s face without the mask. When he applied for the job, Xiao Chen claimed that he had disfigured his face and that taking it off would scare people. In order not to affect the live broadcast and scare away his fans, Du Chonghua let him wear the mask all the time, without a second of it off, so he has never seen Xiao Chen’s real appearance.

When Xiao Chen heard his words, his phoenix eyes twitched, and he smiled behind the mask without saying a word.

He put down the bags in his hands, then took off the backpack he was carrying to place it on a generally clean area of land beside him. Taking out a few bottles of water inside, he distributed each bottle to everyone one by one.

When all was said and done, he was aware that his role in the team was to be a tool man.

Although Xiao Chen endured many hardships and worked very hard, not even making a peep in the process, maybe because of the initial impressions engraved in their hearts, but in the eyes of the girls of the group, Xiao Chen was just a country bumpkin, a poor ghost, an ugly monster. It wasn’t worth mentioning how much they disdained him, coldly treated him; They weren’t even on the same level.

As soon as they saw him coming to deliver water, the disdain in their eyes deepened, as if they were afraid of touching him and getting their hands dirty.

Especially Annie, who had a princess complex ; When she saw Xiao Chen approaching, she started screeching, her voice piercing and sharp. She took a few steps back and shouted loudly, “You hideous monster! Stay away from me.”

The voice wasn’t polite in the slightest, very blunt and hostile.

Xiao Chen’s hand that reached out with the water paused, his phoenix eyes dangerously narrowing.

Then he let out a sneer that the people around him couldn’t see.

Ah.

At the same time, the live broadcast room brilliantly exploded.

[ Do You Want Medicine: Is this still our Fairy Annie? Treating the little assistant with this kind of attitude?

Little Cutie Please Praise Me: Hehe, it’s really like Fairy Annie, to treat people so differently.

Peppa Pig: If you don’t accept that, let’s fight. Our Annie is a sheltered noble lady, she’s bound to be a little more sensitive than others. If you don’t like to see it, you can get out. I have no words.

Mirror Mirror: Wow, I took a screenshot when she screamed just now, her expression really was too ferocious, just like a mouse. ]

Annie saw that Xiao Chen didn’t leave because of her dislike, but instead stood where he was. Already very uncomfortable, she once again glanced over the comments, and her anger burst through the roof. Originally squatting on the ground to rest, she shot up to stand with a ‘bang’, as if having an urge to violently throw hands with Xiao Chen.

Maybe in her heart she felt that it was impossible for a person like Xiao Chen to fight back against her.

Du Chonghua’s brows skipped, internally thinking not good’, and planned to intervene, but before he could make any moves, he froze on the spot.

It was unknown what was going on, but as Annie stood up straight and was about to take a step, she suddenly staggered, as if her shoulders were being crushed by something. With a very hard push, she slammed face first into the ground like a dog eating sh*t, directly into a mud pit, splashing muddy water all over the place.

Not just her face and hair, her clothes were also covered with mud. She even tripped onto a small sharp stone which half-embedded into the flesh of her knee, causing her to bleed.

She hugged her leg and groaned in pain, disregarding how sorry of a figure her beautiful girl image seemed now. Her carefully maintained expressions very clearly disappeared off her face, and the agonizing pain almost caused her to faint.

Although this scene did make people feel a little worried, Annie’s falling posture was way too funny. The rest of the groups’ live broadcast rooms happened to record this scene, thus another round of discussion was sparked.

[ Strawberry Jam: Hahahaha, although it looks very distressing, the way she fell is really funny!

Martin Boots: Damn, really ugly, also looks so dirty.

Big Red Gown Lala: Hurry up and take a screenshot! Let us record this beautiful moment, now there’s another piece of blackmail material for the future.

Teddy Bear: To be honest, I really don’t like Annie. She doesn’t treat people politely at all, and always has an arrogant look.

Spongebob Squarepants: Did I see wrong…is Annie’s nose crooked?

Maple Leaf’s Red: A plastic surgery operation has been confirmed!

Black Cat White Cat: What! Is it not just tripping onto a small stone? Is it necessary to be pained to this point? ]

“Ahhhhh, it hurts so much! Ah ah ah—-” Annie didn’t care about the muddy floor and started rolling about, seeming to be in a miserable state.

Everyone else at the scene showed impatience, thinking Annie was being way too hypocritical.

How could it be that painful?

In actuality, it really was that painful.

With Xiao Chen’s face covered by the mask, the corners of his mouth silently curled up, eyes filled with coldness and indifference.

Annie’s pain sensitivity was magnified at least twenty times, so this kind of pain would make her feel like her bones were shattered, similar to being fractured.

But in the eyes of others, Annie just nicked her knee and she still screamed; definitely had a princess complex, throwing a hissy fit like this.

In order to show the friendship between group members, Su Lele stepped forward.

Suppressing her disdain, she planned to help Annie get up.

When Annie saw her walking over with her phone in hand, camera pointed directly at her face, she was instantly filled with anger, feeling like the other was just coming over to humiliate her.

The next second, she grabbed onto Su Lele’s ankle, and Su Lele was directly pulled into the mud pit.

Luckily, Su Lele reacted relatively quickly, using her hands to support herself, and didn’t fall too tragically.

But her clothes still got dirty, and her phone was smashed to the point where the entire screen was cracked, the screen edges looking like lace .

Su Lele’s face turned black in an instant. After all, she was not a fuel-efficient lamp . She didn’t care whether or not she was live broadcasting anymore, she exacted her revenge and expressed her anger by directly kicking Annie hard several times before stomping on her face.

Annie’s originally damaged face was destroyed even more after Su Lele’s torment; now not only was her nose crooked, but her eyelids also collapsed.

Coupled with how dirty she looked, she seemed exactly like a putrid smelling rat found in the underground tunnels.

Su Lele sneered, stood up, and patted off the mud on her body. Without turning her head, she walked to the back of the camera to tidy up her clothes.

[ Flamingo: Hahahahaha
Little Zhao Little Zhao: Hahahahaha.

Champagne Rose: Hahahahaha, although it’s not very kind, I still laughed.

My Idol Is Number One In The World: It feels inexplicably invigorating watching those stomps!

Witch Nana: Hahahaha, don’t stop, please keep going. She did what I always wanted to do. ]

For a moment, the scene was extremely chaotic.

In the end, it was Du Chonghua who stood up and smoothed things over, strongly enduring his discomfort to help Annie up and calming down everyones’ emotions.

During the whole process, no one’s attention fell on Xiao Chen, practically everyone forgot that the beginning of the entire incident was because Annie wanted to throw hands with Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen silently stood in the corner, fingers gently stroking the pendant around his neck.

The corners of his mouth curled up, but his eyes still appeared gentle and kind.

Annie was so dirty that she couldn’t wash off all the mud even after using several bottles of mineral water. In order to preserve water, just in case there might be something else that had to be washed later, Du Chonghua ordered her to stop washing. Annie broke down again and quarreled with him.

Roaring at Du Chonghua while weeping, it really was embarrassing.

This was the biggest failure she had experienced since live broadcasting for so long, and she didn’t have the nerves to read the comments of her fans on her phone.

Thinking of this, she glared viciously at the expressionless Su Lele and the silent Xiao Chen, her murderous intent tangible even on the audience’s side of the broadcasting screen.

Go to hell!

Annie looked fiercely at the surrounding people who just stood by spectating, gritting her teeth.

It’s all your guys’ fault!!

Why did they record her in such a miserable state?

They’re all looking at her as if she’s a joke, damn it!

It was only when Annie picked up her phone and closed the live broadcast that she saw her face clearly.

The nose was sunken, the eyelids were drooping, and the shape of her mouth was crooked!

“AHHHHHHHH!” Annie crazily smashed her phone into the ground, completely unable to accept reality.

The whole world knows!

Everyone saw it!

Ah ah ah ah ah!

[ Blue: I’m gonna puke! You look like this, yet still have the face to call others an ugly monster! A hideous appearance with a vicious heart !

Ball Race: The fans turned black, and Laozi’s leaving. Let’s just treat the money I spent before as a pile of nothing.

The Towel Family: Can’t take it anymore, it hurts my eyes just to take another glance. ]

At last, it was still Du Chonghua who couldn’t bear it, and asked Xiao Chen for a new mask before handing it to Annie.

Annie put on the mask while clenching her jaw.

The things she has suffered today will definitely be returned by a hundred, no, a thousand times!

The farce finally came to an end, and the sky soon darkened.

Fortunately they’ve done some preparation beforehand; the food, water, and tents for camping were all brought along, so that they wouldn’t be left out in the wilderness.

After the live broadcasts closed, all the faces of the people who were smiling and participating enthusiastically before immediately shutted down, expressions crumbling. They didn’t bother pretending to be in a good mood.

What little death squad, what teammate friendships? It was all bullsh*t, in essence it was just mutual benefits and reciprocity, brushing up from each others’ hype, and gaining more fans.

Du Chonghua, who had been holding back his rage all this time, was close to slapping Annie’s face after closing the live broadcast.

Not competent to succeed but still had enough competence to fail.

All things considered, Annie was now isolated and ignored by everyone.

Her face was ruined, yet she still dreamed of counter-attacking?

As soon as this trip was over, the woman would be kicked out of the team.

Just wait for her popularity to diminish first.

Peh!

Everyone harbored ulterior motives.

As soon as Xiao Chen stepped into his one-person tent, without even having the time to lie down and rest, someone grabbed his waist from behind. Taking advantage of his unpreparedness, that certain someone bound him tightly to himself, almost crushing him to death.

The man buried his face and rubbed his chin on the side of Xiao Chen’s neck, movements gentle and lingering, with a hint of teasing, and said dotingly, “Baby, miss me?”

Xiao Chen paused, then used his elbow to jab at the man and loosen his grip. He turned around in the man’s arms, and silently looked at the gray eyes in the darkness.

The man smiled, and stretched out his hand to take off the mask that covered Xiao Chen’s face. Looking at the soft and delicate facial features, the man licked his lips, then without a word took the initiative to move close, nibbling and biting.

Xiao Chen stretched out his hand, hooked the man’s neck, and catered to him.

They’re an old couple, with flirting and the like, they weren’t shy at all.

It was unknown how long the kiss lasted before the man reluctantly ended the kiss. The distance between each others’ faces was only two centimeters, and they looked at each other quietly.

Xiao Chen snorted coldly, “Now you’ve finally decided to come look for me. I came to this world so early, what were you doing?”

Ding Hezhi kissed the youth’s eyebrows, rubbing his hands dishonestly against Xiao Chen’s lower waist, “I was wrong, forgive me, en?”

Xiao Chen was amused by this man’s expression, before slapping him across the face. “Where have you learned to be cute, it’s shameful to be this cute.”


It was all quiet at midnight.

In the remote wilderness, where the surroundings were all primitive mountains and land, everywhere was covered with a blanket of turbid darkness.

Seven identically colored tents stood under a few relatively large locust trees. From a distance, they seemed to be inexplicably integrated with heaven and earth, while also giving off a visually stimulating feeling of raised tombs in a graveyard, very gloomy and spooky.

Those locust trees were very tall, and it was unknown how old they were, but the tree bark appeared so old that it looked like it would fall off in the next second.

In fact, all the surrounding trees were of the same kind, there were no other plants except for the locust trees, not even a single weed. Such a scene was super rare and appalling.

It wasn’t known if the group was unconcerned or reckless, to feel as though there was nothing wrong.

“Kekekeke.”

From the terribly silent night came the sudden laughter of an unknown woman.

The cloudy wind whooshed, like a ghost’s wail or wolf’s howl .

Whoever heard this would tremble all over, backs cold with sweat.

The soundly asleep people were awakened one by one by the horrifying laugh, chills running down their spines.

“ Jiejiejiejie —”

The sounds then turned into a man’s grim laugh.

It really made the ends of their hair stand straight up.

“Hehehehe—”

Then there came the joyous laughter of children playing.

Finally, hearing the weird sounds, the group of people couldn’t bear it any longer, and tremblingly poked their heads out of their tents, looking around cautiously.

Coincidentally, the group of people met each others’ gaze in unison. With the awkward silence, no one knew what to do. At close range, the meager moonlight allowed them to see the horror and fear that couldn’t be concealed in their eyes.

“Damn, this place wouldn’t actually be haunted right?” Zhao Junlu spoke out first, his voice carrying a faint tremble.

Du Chonghua thought of something, a strange gleam flashing across his eyes. Voice hoarse, he shouted loudly, “Didn’t we go on this trip just for something like this? Everyone take out your phones and prepare to live broadcast, if there really is something big that’s happening this time, then we will become first-rate celebrities when we get back!”

When he said it like this, the gazes of the originally frightened people lit up, their eyes flashing with traces of greed and desire.

Maybe because their ambitions overshadowed their fear, or because of something else, everyone regardlessly took out their phones, preparing their selfie sticks and organizing their hair and clothes as quickly as possible. The girls even applied makeup powder and lipstick.

“Hey, this is Wang Xueke. Tonight our little death squad has overcome our fears to camp out in the woods on the way to the Old Locust Tree Manor. Although we haven’t reached our destination, we still have some unexpected gains tonight.” The person who was the fastest to open their live broadcast was Wang Xueke, the one who wore a JK uniform earlier. She turned on the phone’s flashlight and shone it on her face.

She opened a sliver of the tent and pointed the camera outside, “You guys can listen to the sounds coming from somewhere nearby.”

“Jiejiejiejie—”

“Kekekeke—”

Countless kinds of laughter intertwined, from men, women, children, and elders. The laughter overlapped, somewhat ethereal, like the whisper of the devil from hell.

[ LGBT Robes: Damn, this laughter is really horrifying? What the hell?

I Want To Buy A Boyfriend: ???? The heck? Anchor, don’t swindle me like this, it’s so late at night, the laughter scared me so much I fell off the bed, f*ck.

Camisole: Sorry, I’ve been persuaded by this, I’m leaving now!

Green Forest: ?? Damn, that scared me to death! ]

Looking at the comments that were flashing past the mobile phone screen, maybe it was because of that added psychological comfort of a live audience, but Wang Xueke’s originally shaking legs actually stopped.

[ Ultra-short Sex: Anchor, go out and take a look, I want to know what’s going on outside.

Sunflower’s Gentle Smile: Yes yes yes! I second!

Slackers Can’t Stay Up Late: Second +1! ]

Looking at the insistent comments, Wang Xueke still hesitated for a few seconds, after all, she was actually very scared.

She would never have thought that there was someone who was a few steps ahead of her who’d already started live broadcasting outside.

From outside came the sound of hurried footsteps, followed by a sweet female voice.

Wearing a mask, Annie changed her usual casual live broadcast style, managing to gather up enough courage and boldness to rush outside alone without any fear of death.

Even if her face was disfigured, so what? Just wait for her to go back and patch things up, with some fine adjustments, she’d still be a little fairy.

Rather than death, what she was more afraid of now was losing fans. Then she’d no longer be able to continue being an internet celebrity, and would no longer be able to enjoy the feeling of being revered by her admiring fans.

[ Snow White: Vomiting! We already saw what your face looked like during the day, no matter how much you use your mask to cover it now, it’s all useless!

Superman Is Back: Go baby Annie! Mom will always support you!

Cute Kangaroo: F*ck, I can’t take it anymore. I may as well just go and watch the other group members’ live broadcasts. I almost threw up during the day today, really speechless. ]

Annie squinted her eyes as she read the comments on her broken phone screen, excluding a sinister aura, only this time she learned to behave well, and didn’t yell at anyone or make any kind of fuss. If it weren’t for the people in the live broadcast room already knowing what happened during the day, they would’ve thought that her temper changed for the better.

Listening to the noise outside, Xiao Chen shifted, about to stand up. The person didn’t even stand up straight before suddenly being grabbed by a man, staggering back into the man’s embrace.

Jing Hezhi bit the tip of Xiao Chen’s nose, and said pitifully, “You don’t care about me anymore, we haven’t even cuddled for that long.”

The man really became increasingly childish the more he aged, firmly grasping Xiao Chen’s weakness. He knew the other party really couldn’t stand him acting coquettishly and sweet-talking, but he still used such tricks.

Seeing this, Xiao Chen pinched the man’s chin with both hands, and tugged unceremoniously from side to side. Looking at the man’s face that had been played to such an embarrassing degree, Xiao Chen was amused, “It was clearly you who proposed to enter these small worlds, yet you’re blaming me now!”

After he spoke, Xiao Chen fiercely bit the man’s neck, as if to vent his anger.

Jing Hezhi just stroked Xiao Chen’s back, pampering the other’s every move with a smile on his face. The love in his eyes was about to overflow.

“Xiao Chen, grab your things, let’s hurry and reach the Old Locust Tree Manor tonight!” came Du Chonghua’s voice.

His footsteps were in a hurry, and he even breathed a little urgently. Panting heavily, he flippantly told Xiao Chen outside of his tent, and then left to go in the direction of another tent.

Xiao Chen’s lips curled up, deciding to let go of the man’s punishment. The man then gently kissed the corner of his eyes, with a bit of lingering tenderness.

Just like how he came, the man quietly disappeared into the darkness and left.

In the narrow tent, Xiao Chen was left alone again.

Xiao Chen put on his mask and sorted out his emotions, preparing to go outside.

It was unknown if it was because of staying with the man for too long, but he found that he, just like the man, enjoyed watching others send themselves to die so that he could dance in front of their grave ; really it’s the non-stop courting death behavior.

Although it seemed like a vicious interest, that being said, it’s still really interesting.

Otherwise, the two of them would not have been bored to the point of entering worlds, playing some role-playing games, and trying all different kinds of strange play.

Duan Aoming, the blond man with the lowest sense of presence in the team, together with Su Lele; it was unclear when they hooked up, but when they were woken up by the strange laughter, they were both in a tent, disheveled.

When Du Chonghua opened Duan Aoming’s tent, the two of them were still putting on their clothes. He frowned, with everything pretty much figured out. “Hurry up everyone, whether or not we can skyrocket our popularity all depends on the fate of tonight.”

Annie pointed at the surrounding environment with her phone, and began to explain. “We originally set up our tents under these trees to rest, and were then woken up by this strange laughter. You guys listen.”

[ Little Bastard: Are the surroundings just locust trees? Why are there no other trees around?

Little Lollipop Cutie: This flashlight makes her face look so scary…and it’s even accompanied by this kind of bgm ….

BMO Nana: No, haven’t any of you noticed that there seems to be something hanging on the locust tree behind the anchor?

Primrose Grass: My god, anchor, hurry up and look behind you!!

Cherry Red Bean Paste: Mom, that white thing moved! ]

Annie looked at the comments that flashed across the screen, as well as the swarm of exclamation marks, her heart couldn’t help but thump.

Turning her head stiffly, she timidly looked behind her back.

From the audience’s point of view, only a piece of white square cloth could be seen hanging from the tree, with the wind causing it to sway from side to side.

But that wasn’t the case for Annie!

She could clearly see that it wasn’t just a piece of white cloth, but instead a white dress!

Not to mention….

There was a person hanging on there too!

“Ahhhhhhh —” Annie’s legs softened, and she directly knelt onto the ground. Her pupils shrank, and her whole body seemed to have been exhausted of its strength.

Her voice overlapped with the pervasive laughter around her, screams completely drowned out by the laughter.

“Jiejiejiejiejie—”

“Kekekekeke—”

Annie’s whole body was cold, without any warmth. It was like falling into an ice cellar.

As for the hanging man, his tongue stuck out far, hands and feet hanging limply by his sides, his eyes flipped so that only white showed, face ferociously savage.

Suddenly, its stiff head moved. Whites rolling around, tongue retracted, with a smile, its gaze fixed directly on the completely petrified woman.

It just so happened that Annie’s phone was pointed in that direction.

[ Socialism: Ahhhhhhh! Mom, I’ve become blind! I’m blind!

Dry Brush: Wuwuwu, I’m so frightened I’m scared to tears!

Little Fox Patterned Cat: Anchor, quickly spill, are you faking a ghost to trick us? It’s over, I believe it now! There really are ghosts in this world!

Guoji in a Thermos: Prosperity, democracy, civilization, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, law, patriotism, dedication, honesty ……

Bye-bye Mary: Prosperity, democracy, civilization, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, law, patriotism, dedication, honesty……

Be A Fairy: Excuse me, I shouldn’t have joined this live broadcast room, goodbye! See you never!! ]

The live broadcast room was once again covered by the socialist twenty-four-character maxim.

Xiao Chen stepped out of the tent, seeing the scene in front of him, he narrowed his eyes slightly, and began to muse.

When locust trees face shade, wood ghosts become one.

A corpse is buried under every locust tree, so there are as many ghosts here as locust trees.

Roughly estimating, there were probably hundreds or even thousands of unjust ghosts around.

The fierce ghost head that was happily spinning on the branch turned its head, gaze accidentally falling onto Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen could feel that the other’s body went visibly stiff, even forgetting to move his tongue.

One person and one ghost stared at each other.

“……”

“……”

The ghost seemed to have seen something frightening, the whites of its eyes spun quickly. It rolled down from the tree, and then disappeared in a flash, as if it was running for its life.

“…………”

What, was he really that scary ?


Su Lele and Duan Aoming walked out together, turned on the mobile phone flashlight, then scanned their surroundings.

A casual scan revealed Annie, who’d been scared dumb.

The grievances Su Lele had during the day were still there. Rolling her eyes, she expressed her displeasure and impatience.

The moment they came out was very timely, the white shadow on the tree had already disappeared.

So when they saw Annie sobbing spasmodically, screaming with her hands wrapped around her head, their first reaction was that the woman was messing around again.

Du Chonghua was still frozen in place, his heart beating rapidly, hands and feet completely cold.

Holding a selfie stick in his hand, live broadcast already opened, that amazing scene just now was recorded by the live broadcasting room. The amount of gifts sent by fans exploded, and even the number of fans increased at a speed visible to the naked eye, soaring sky high.

In this short period of time, the amount of gifts he received was equal to the amount he worked hard to earn on a normal weekday.

He gritted his teeth, the greed in his heart drastically increasing.

He wanted to be popular!

Everyone packed up pretty quickly. After all, this was not the first time they went on an adventure, and they’ve long become familiar with what things were necessary, how everything was used, how to reduce the weight of their backpack, and so on.

The surrounding laughter gradually became louder. As if it were going to pierce peoples’ eardrums, like some kind of magical sound, anyone who heard would be scared witless.

“How far is the Old Locust Tree Manor?” Wang Xueke’s heart trembled as she listened to the laughter that seemed to come from nowhere.

Having heard what was asked, Du Chonghua looked at the map on his phone. Eyes widening, he moved the phone closer to himself.

How was this possible?

During the day, it clearly displayed that there was at least a distance of 50 kilometers between them and the Old Locust Tree Manor, but when he turned on his phone, it showed that they were now only one kilometer away from the Old Locust Tree Manor!

This also meant that they actually only need to walk approximately ten minutes to reach their destination!

Du Chonghua revealed a happy expression.

“Quick! Get ready, everyone! We are only one kilometer away from the Old Locust Tree Manor, and we will reach our destination very soon!” His voice boomed out, even the ethereal laughter around him did not overwhelm and obscure his voice.

As the squad’s tool man, Xiao Chen was responsible for carrying the luggage and being the head bird .

Du Chonghua’s eyes flashed, and sternly shouted, “Xiao Chen, you come lead the way!”

Xiao Chen heard his words, his eyebrows slightly raised, very noncommittal.

Ah.

In the original plot, Xiao Chen’s character was really the first to become cannon fodder.

After he became cannon fodder, the group focused on who would carry the luggage and how to split the luggage weight. They got into an argument, and in the process another person got killed by a ghost.

In short, without exception, the whole squad died.

Xiao Chen fearlessly and leisurely walked to the front of the group.

Du Chonghua originally planned to use his authority to pressure him, worried he was unwilling, but he didn’t expect him to be so cooperative.

With already prepared lines, Du Chonghua awkwardly and abruptly stopped his sentence, then stiffly held back what was about to be said.

“Let’s go.” Du Chonghua said towards the back.

Everyone already turned on the live broadcast software and held up their phones in the strange night. They communicated non-stop with their fans, asking for gratuity.

Annie didn’t say a word from beginning to end, but just turned on the camera in a daze.

The fans that were there earlier in her live broadcast room saw the weird scene and were all comforting her. Only some people who came later were confused, not knowing what the fans were comforting Annie about, continuously spamming the live broadcast for information.

Xiao Chen’s footsteps weren’t very sluggish, it was completely impossible to see that he was carrying a lot of things. Even though he carried several bags and held more in his hands, his back was very straight from beginning to end.

Du Chenghua didn’t know if it was just a misconception, he kept feeling that Xiao Chen, who was walking in front of him, seemed very leisurely and carefree. It was as though he didn’t have any fear, very much like a nobleman going on an adventure.

Walking forward according to the map, the alarming laughter gradually disappeared, returning back to the seemingly peaceful silence, allowing the group of people to slowly relax their vigilance.

Xiao Chen’s eyes flickered slightly, the tips of his ears moving accordingly.

His current five senses were almost ten times as magnified as ordinary people, He could clearly hear something on the ground slithering, rubbing against the ground and letting out rustling sounds.

It was obvious that the sounds were coming towards them.

Xiao Chen’s lips once again hooked up, the face behind the mask ruminating.

“Ahhhh—-” Wang Xueke was holding her phone and running her live broadcast, but then there was suddenly something that landed straight on top of her head , the tail of the thing poking straight into her eye.

It was a snake!

“Ahhhhhhhh!” Wang Xueke was too afraid to move, her face ashen. She could clearly feel the thing moving on her head, the cold snake scales pressed onto her skin, making her hair stand on end.

[ Don’t Sit Cross Legged: F*ck f*ck f*ck, my god, don’t show me this, it’s too disgusting!

Yellow Towel: Ahhh! I have goosebumps now, goodness gracious, there’s a snake!

Save Toilet Paper: Help, help! I can’t look anymore, I’m afraid of snakes the most, someone quickly come help this blogger! I feel like this snake will bite her at any second!

Striped Zebra: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! ]

Su Lele and Duan Aoming, the two people closest to Wang Xueke, were scared off at the same time, both legs trembling.

Wang Xueke’s tears rapidly fell, sobbing softly with ‘wuwuwu’ sounds.

That snake on her head moved a little, then followed her cheek to crawl down slowly.

Wang Xueke’s whole person was frozen, with her widened eyes, frightened that cold sweat flowed out. The feeling of hard scales moving down her face made her almost faint with fear.

She used her eyes and asked for help to the people around her, but even when Du Chonghua met her gaze, he consciously avoided eye contact.

No one was willing to help her!

[ Educated And Knowledgeable: Damn, these people still aren’t going to help the anchor, really too cold-blooded!

Up And Down The Whole Body: I seemed to have witnessed the so-called teammate friendship today, I thought that everyone in the little death squad had a pretty good relationship!

Are You Thin: I’m convinced, if I were the anchor I’m afraid my heart would already be cold, too motherf*cking f*cked up, damn!

Skateboard Shoes: I’m going to faint just from looking at it, I really can’t imagine how broken Keke’s heart is now! ]

Looking at the cold-blooded scene in front of him, Xiao Chen sneered in his heart. It was unknown what he was thinking, but he dropped the bags in his hands onto the ground, and under everyone’s astonished eyes started walking forward.

“………”

“………”

Xiao Chen and Wang Xueke met each other’s gaze, the despair in the girl’s eyes clearly visible. The moment she saw Xiao Chen take a step forward, her eyes flashed with light, filled with hope and the need for help.

Xiao Chen squinted his eyes, the corner of his lips hooking up as the three inch snake lying on Wang Xueke’s face was directly lifted using his bare hands.

The snake was very docile. When it was being pinched up by Xiao Chen, its tail even gently hooked Xiao Chen’s wrist, as if trying to please him.

Xiao Chen looked left and right to confirm the direction where Annie was, then intentionally pretended to unintentionally throw the snake over there.

“Ah ah ah ah!” Annie was spooked out of her mind, though Xiao Chen’s speed and strength was well controlled. The snake basically only brushed past Annie’s shoulder without latching onto her body, but it was still enough to scare her.

[ Love Is Deep And Ever-lasting: Damn, the little assistant is awesome!

Protect My Family’s Big Brother For His Whole Life: Ahhhhhhhh! He actually directly used his bare hands! It’s too scary.

Summer Summer: My mom asked why I was kneeling while watching the live broadcast, so frightening.

Blue Beauty : F*ck, turns out there’s actually someone bold enough to catch the snake with just their hands? Is that snake poisonous or not? Looking at it even makes me a little scared!

Coconut Under The Coconut Tree: I’ve been won over as a fan of the little assistant, my god! Movements quick and fluent, it’s just too cool alright? ]

The rest of the group, including Wang Xueke, were all stunned by Xiao Chen’s series of unexpected moves. Dumbfounded, they felt as though they were meeting this person for the first time.

Wang Xueke still felt a little tremble in her heart. After she finally confirmed that the snake was taken away by someone, her legs weakened to collapse on the ground, loudly crying out.

With no snake in the vicinity, Xiao Chen walked back to his original position silently. When he passed by Du Chonghua, he could clearly see the horror and fear in his eyes.

And also a disdain that had nowhere to go .

Tsk.

Xiao Chen was too lazy to care about him, picking up the bag that was discarded on the ground, patting the dirt off, and started carrying it again.

All at this moment, everyone looked at each other, and with tacit understanding actually started to walk forward in an artificial manner. With caring expressions likesuddenly flipping from winter to summer, they were very concerned and caring.

The compassion at this time greatly contrasted with what just happened, leaving the people in the live broadcast room speechless.

[ I Want A Boyfriend: This is the first time in my life that I have experienced first hand what it means to be duplicitous.

🎶 : I f*cking vomited watching this, their acting skills are really too bad, you laugh so awkwardly and still dare pretend to console, it’s really laughable to death.

I’m Really Not Pornographic: Tsk tsk tsk, the little death squad faked their friendships!

Buying A Facial Mask: Hahahaha, I think Wang Xueke has ten thousand llamas flying in her heart . I can’t bear to look anymore, these people really are too indifferent. ]

Wang Xueke was so frightened she lost her voice, her heart pounding non-stop. Looking at the hypocritical faces surrounding her, she felt so disgusted that she almost vomited.

How f*cking hypocritical, this group of people! Doesn’t she usually help them out a lot? Never expected them all to be so cold-blooded!

Who would have thought?

At such a critical moment, the only person who offered her a helping hand was Xiao Chen, whom she always looked down upon and didn’t even want to talk to!

Thinking to this point, the weak legged Wang Xueke slowly raised her head, looking at the man who did not pay any attention to himself and had his eyes lowered, Xiao Chen. Her heart felt sour and complicated.

Xiao Chen stood still, and continued to listen to the rustling sounds that continuously crept closer.

Paired with the farce just now, he already had seven or eight answers in mind.

The sounds didn’t come from just one direction.

Instead, it was from all directions at the same time.

How many were there?

Tsk tsk.

It really was incalculable.

Annie, who was originally squatting next to Wang Xueke, suddenly widened her eyes and jumped up from the ground in fright. Her voice trembling and frightened, she immediately screamed, attracting the attention of the people around her. “Ahhhhhh! Quick, look at the ground!”

Everyone immediately followed her warning and looked at the ground.

Damn, really doomed to die.

The fun begins now!



In the dark and gloomy night, all surroundings were very obscured.

Everyone held their mobile phone and turned their flashlights on, shining the light on the ground to see their surrounding environment clearly.

When the group finally heard sounds similar to that of raindrops hitting the ground, making a very dense and intense noise, it was already too late.

Countless snakes had already rushed over from all directions.

Like a continuously shrinking black hole, the swarm of snakes seemed to automatically set them as the center and encircle them, creating a chaotic and unpredictable scene. From a distance, the ground, which had a faint reflection even at night, looked like it was suddenly enveloped by something pitch-black that kept shrinking .

“Ahhhhhhhh!”

“Ah ah ah ah–”

The startled group immediately scattered.

“What should we do? What should we do?” The girls’ eyes went red with panic, even the boys were on the verge of a breakdown.

Du Chonghua himself, who usually remained calm, could only freeze in place.

[ I’m The Prettiest: Ahhh! I have enochlophobia! I’m going to die!

Big Ocean Blue Sky: Damn, these people are really asking for trouble! Who in their right mind goes to this kind of cursed place?

I Want To Eat Ice Cream: Wuwuwu, I shouldn’t have clicked on this livestream, waaah.

Ice King: I was originally eating something, seeing this scared me so much I threw up…… ]

What to do? What to do?

Zhao Junlu had enochlophobia. He shuddered, grasping his chest with the hand that wasn’t holding his selfie stick, he started retching.

Du Chonghua’s palms were clammy with sweat. He scanned his surroundings and his gaze inadvertently fell on Xiao Chen.

In this tense and anxious atmosphere, he didn’t even have time to wonder why Xiao Chen seemed so calm and unafraid.

He only had one thing in his mind.

Du Chonghua directly rushed over, shouting loudly, “Xiao Chen, quickly take out the lighter!”

Xiao Chen raised an eyebrow, the corners of his mouth slightly lifting.

Pretty smart.

Xiao Chen took out the lighter from his pocket and handed it to Du Chonghua. Du Chonghua’s hands were still trembling, and he seemed to be breathing unevenly. It was clear that at this moment, he was extremely anxious.

After some hesitation, he took off his blue T-shirt in front of everyone, then removed his phone from the selfie stick and tucked it in his pants pocket. He tightly wrapped his T-shirt around the top of the selfie stick and tied it securely.

He looked around and his gaze skimmed over the scared, trembling people. “Does anyone have makeup remover? Give it to me!”

Su Lele reacted, hurriedly rummaging through her backpack before finally finding her makeup remover.

Without waiting for her to hand it over, Du Chonghua rushed towards her with big strides, snatching the makeup remover from Su Lele’s hands. Forcefully opening the cap, he poured the makeup remover onto the shirt he just tied.

Du Chonghua’s eyes turned red from urgency, the veins on his hands bulging. He took out the lighter and ignited the T-shirt.

With the help of the makeup remover, the T-shirt quickly caught fire. However, the snakes surrounding them were already closing in. Besides the snakes slithering on the ground, many had also climbed up the locust trees around them, crawling along the branches.

Then, like Olympic divers diving into the water, they dove down one by one from above the group, inflicting horror and causing people to scream while dodging left and right.

Du Chonghua continued to shout, “Take out the umbrellas!”

The people immediately obeyed, as if waking from a dream.

This time, Du Chonghua, holding an umbrella and with a torch in hand, ran forward to the front. He bent down and aimed at the ground, planning to murder the snakes and carve a path, shouting, “Follow me!”

Who would dare to not listen at a time like this?

Du Chonghua, despite feeling nauseous, started to move forward. Although the snakes feared fire, the torch’s flames were just too small. Du Chonghua even stepped on a snake’s slippery tail several times.

Damn it! F*cking hell, this was driving him crazy!

Du Chonghua swore in his mind while continuing forward.

They managed to clear a somewhat clear path.

Even Du Chonghua struggled to continue pushing; One could only imagine the condition of his teammates following him.

As soon as Du Chonghua’s torch went farther away, the snakes would slowly regroup again, and continue moving towards the center of the swarm.

The boys were a bit better off, wearing sports shoes and long pants. However, the three girls present were all beauty-conscious livestreamers, dressed in the most figure-hugging short shorts . At least, for the sake of ease while walking, no one was foolish enough to wear high heels or sandals.

“Wahhh!” Su Lele was extremely reluctant, but at this moment, she had no other choice. She didn’t dare to look at the ground, holding up her umbrella and staring ahead, trying to control her fear, but in the end was still unable to contain her horrified cries.

Furthermore, she could clearly feel something hitting her umbrella with a ‘duang’ sound. It felt as though a huge weight was pressing down on it, the number of snakes dropping down increased more and more. If she didn’t shake her umbrella while walking, the consequences would be unimaginable.

In addition, she had also stepped on the slippery bodies of countless snakes multiple times. That uncomfortable sensation, just thinking about it raised goosebumps and sent shivers down her spine.

Due to the slippery slope, she nearly stumbled several times. Fortunately, Duan Aoming, who shared an umbrella with her, helped her up, allowing her to barely keep up with Du Chonghua’s pace.

Although the scene was chaotic, and no one was able to continue streaming in a delicate and proper manner, they still needed their phones for light. Without being able to exit the live broadcast page, the result was this scene being faithfully recorded in their live broadcast rooms.

[ Cherry Lips: I’m blind! Aaaah! Don’t make me watch this!

Safe And Sound Apple: Du Chonghua truly lives up to his role as the leader of the fearless little death squad. Under these kinds of circumstances, he still managed to come up with an idea quickly. Damn, he won a lot of fans over.

Accompanying You Through The Years: Seriously, I’ve struggled with binge eating for so many years, but now watching this livestream has made me lose my love for food, wuuu.

Canned Peach: Even as a fully grown adult man, just watching this makes my scalp tingle. I can hardly imagine how scared this group of people must be, damn.

See You Never: Just saying, I think Du Chonghua has a really great body! There’s abs!! ]

Compared to the other frazzled members, Xiao Chen, who was walking at the rear, appeared quite relaxed.

He didn’t walk that fast, not even bothering to look carefully at the path in front. Instead, he seemed leisurely and focused more on observing his surroundings.

As soon as his footsteps touched the ground, the snakes nearby seemed to instinctively retreat three feet, not daring to approach even half a step.

It wasn’t worth mentioning how a snake might fall from above him; there wasn’t even a single one that would fall around him. They were all surprisingly obedient.

Strangely, from a distance, the snake swarm appeared dense and numerous, so there should have been innumerable amounts of them. However, Du Chonghua, raising his homemade torch, hadn’t gone very far, and had already broken through the swarm of snakes.

The emotional state of the breathless live broadcasters began to spiral one by one. Some even questioned why they had come to the locust tree manor in the first place, why they hadn’t stayed home, and why they had chosen to subject themselves to all this hardship.

This whole night they barely slept for a short amount of time before being woken up by the eerie laughter. They only took a few steps, and they got attacked by snakes!

The more they thought about it, the more frightened they became.

Zhao Junlu was the first to suggest they retreat, not caring that they were still live streaming. He cautiously said, “Maybe we shouldn’t go to the locust tree manor, it’s better to go back early.”

The survivors of this ordeal largely shared this sentiment, silently agreeing in their hearts.

After all, none of them wanted to die.

Everyone agreed, except for Du Chonghua.

He was truly unwilling to give up!

Du Chonghua forced a strained smile, and said, “It’s the middle of the night, so at this moment we won’t be safe anywhere. There’s still a good few hours until dawn, can you guarantee that in these few hours, we won’t encounter anything strange?”

Zhao Junlu had no words to say, and could only remain silent.

Du Chonghua seized the opportunity to continue persuading them, saying, “What’s our purpose for this trip? Isn’t it for exploration and adventure? Regardless of whether we find the locust tree mansion or not, we were bound to go through these experiences. We might as well just head toward the locust tree mansion.”

This convinced everyone.

Du Chonghua looked at the group, moved yet exhausted, and sighed. He asked in a tone that seemed like a question but left little room for doubt , “What do you all think?”

Su Lele and Duan Aoming exchanged glances and nodded first.

At this point, there was no turning back.

[ Little Fairy: I have to say, among the little death squad, I admire Du Chonghua the most. He’s clear-headed and resourceful. (Of course, he’s also handsome and has a great body; capable of winning anyone and everyone over.)

Miss Jelly: I really can’t understand why they’re doing this kind of livestream for no reason. They’re just asking for trouble . Nowadays, internet celebrities will stop at nothing for fame.

Patrick Star: Uh……do people in the livestream room not know how dangerous the locust tree mansion is?

Twinkle Twinkle Little Star: ???? Upstairs, please educate us! I have no idea!

Skating Cola: I don’t know either! Begging for some information!

Patrick Star: The locust tree mansion was originally discovered by a group of escaped criminals. It contained many antiques, so they got greedy, and decided to loot everything inside. As a result, they all tragically died. When the police pursuing them reached the manor, they immediately reported the artifacts inside to the National Cultural Relics Bureau. Do you know the result??

There have been many nameless thieves who wanted to steal the antiques there, but without exception, they all met unfortunate ends. That’s how the locust tree manor’s malicious reputation spread.

What’s even stranger is that even though we have the locust tree manor’s location on our maps, many people can’t find it, because even when following the map, they end up traveling further and further away…

Nice Chopsticks: No! Wasn’t there an old lady who guided us yesterday? F*ck f*ck f*ck, I’ve got the chills, there’s only me in the house!

Panda Mahjong: Heck, this is really creepy when you think about it!

LuluLulu: Damn, so they’re still going to the locust tree mansion? Isn’t that just offering up their heads ? ]

Du Chonghua saw that he had convinced everyone as the group nodded in agreement.

Duan Aoming took out an extra T-shirt from his backpack and handed it to Du Chonghua.

Du Chonghua quickly put it on.

At this moment, everyone present looked tired and disheveled.

“Let’s go! It’s just a few minutes away!” Du Chonghua reminded.

Xiao Chen watched this impassioned speech from the sidelines, his eyes cold and detached. He licked his dry lips.

Here, no one understood the various rumors about the locust tree mansion better than Du Chonghua. After all, he had organized this event, so he couldn’t be unaware of the fact that many people had died here!

On the other hand, was he really here just to explore with his teammates, or did he have his eye on treasures in the locust tree mansion that didn’t belong to him?

His true intentions were difficult to fathom.

There’s still a long night ahead. Hmm.







The short journey lasted only a few minutes, but was nerve wracking for everyone. Everyone was visibly pale, as they were afraid that some strange thing might suddenly appear in the next second.

“That’s the locust tree manor up ahead, right?” Zhao Junlu excitedly looked at the faintly visible building not far in the distance.

Du Chonghua repositioned himself on the map, and after seeing the displayed results, revealed wild joy. Suppressing the excitement that surged up within him like a raging tide, he said in a low voice, “Yes, this is it!”

They finally found it!

Du Chonghua felt himself become extremely excited, his blood freezing in his veins.

He never thought he would actually find the legendary Locust Tree Manor!

Wang Xueke was walking by Du Chonghua’s side and inadvertently glanced at him.

The light from her phone was reflected slightly in Du Chonghua’s eyes. From her perspective, she could clearly see a strange glint in his eyes, and with the addition of his barely suppressed expression of crazed delight, it gave off an eerie feeling.

Just one casual glance made Wang Xueke inexplicably startled, an indescribable sense of dread welling up inside her.

Du Chonghua regained his composure, and noticed that Wang Xueke was staring at him. After a moment’s pause, he smoothed his expression and asked, “Why are you looking at me like that?”

Du Chonghua’s tone was very light, but for some reason, with a woman’s sixth sense, Wang Xueke felt a hint of threat in his voice.

“It’s nothing,” Wang Xueke replied while withdrawing her gaze, her heartbeat accelerating a little.

Du Chonghua cast a cold glance at her before beckoning to the others, “Let’s go in together!”

The Locust Tree Manor was hidden behind layers of locust trees. Shrouded in darkness, from a distance it appeared as an indistinct silhouette; a vague and sizable structure.

The whole group collectively held their breath as they slowly made their way towards the manor. When they finally arrived, they discovered that the mansion’s entrance was securely locked with a modern iron chain, seeming out of place with the surrounding environment.

[Towel: Hey, won’t that count as breaking and entering private property? (Forgive my unique perspective.)

Running Shoes: Replying to the person upstairs, I would also think so!

Don’t Eat More: Just watching this makes me nervous! Following the order of events in a horror movie, I feel like as soon as they open the door, there will be a ghost in white waiting inside, ready to strangle someone.

Five Blessings: Wait, did anyone notice the pattern on the door? It’s actually a snake biting its own tail! What a strange design.

Cute And Brainless: I know! That’s the Ouroboros!

Full Name: The design is too realistic, it has a type of 3D effect. It makes people feel inexplicably uneasy, very uncomfortable…]

Xiao Chen stood silently to the side, watching Du Chonghua skillfully take out lock-picking tools to get rid of the lock.

However, his attention was unconsciously drawn to the carving on the wooden door, that of the Ouroboros.

The snake’s body was half yin and half yang, twisted into a circular pattern, just like the Arabic numeral eight , with the snake’s head biting its own tail.

Xiao Chen narrowed his eyes and stared at the pattern with a pensive expression.

The Ouroboros is an extremely common symbol in religion and mythology, representing the concept of “infinity” and the meanings of self-devouring and infinite cycles.

The appearance of such a pattern in this place could not be a coincidence.

Xiao Chen couldn’t help but admire his shrewd old Gong, who had allowed him to glimpse the general plot direction, but still left him completely unaware of the movie details.

He said he wanted him to savor it.

Fine, for now, he’ll treat it as an interesting aspect of their married life .

“It’s open!” With a satisfying click, Du Chonghua excitedly shouted, turning to look at the nervous group of people.

“Come on! Let’s go in!”

Annie watched the number of viewers in her livestream steadily decrease. Seeing more traffic flowing into Su Lele and Wang Xueke’s livestreams, she clenched her teeth and indignantly blurted out, “How about I lead the way!”

As soon as she finished her sentence, Annie felt the urge to slap herself, regretting it to death.

Everyone, including Su Lele, looked at her with incredulous expressions, and even Du Chonghua seemed somewhat shocked.

[Little Kart Racing Prince: I’m dying of laughter, did you see everyone’s expression when Annie said she would lead the way? It’s like the look you‘d give to a mentally challenged child, hilarious.

Strawberries Are So Delicious: Sure, let her lead the way! She’s practically serving herself up on a silver platter, hahahaha! Why does this woman have so many scenes to act !

Paulownia Tree : Let her lead! I want to see how she messes up, hahahaha.]

A sliver of amusement flashed in Du Chonghua’s eyes, feeling a momentary satisfaction upon hearing Annie’s words, he quickly suppressed the emerging emotions.

When someone offers to pave the way for you, don’t outright reject it.

Du Chonghua followed up on her words, “Since you’re so willing, go ahead!”

Annie had originally expected Du Chonghua to flatly reject her suggestion, allowing her to successfully continue hiding in the middle of the group. However, she never imagined that he would actually agree and follow through with her words, leaving her in an awkward and self-imposed situation.

She forced a strained smile, even though her eyes were mostly hidden behind a mask, it was not hard to see that she was on the verge of collapse and denial.

“Alright.”

Seeing Annie’s discomfort, Su Lele couldn’t help but chuckle at her eagerness to take the lead and send herself off.

Ugly people often act up the most , really laughable.

Annie swallowed hard, her hands trembling.

Du Chonghua directly made a path for her and let Annie open the door.

Annie clutched her phone tightly, gathering her courage before slowly pushing the door.

In that instant, her mind had already conjured up many horrific images: white shadow ghosts hanging from the ceiling, red-clothed ghosts drifting around and eluding sight, elderly ghosts with faces as wrinkled as tree bark, hideous and terrifying……

She continuously gave herself internal pep talks to prepare her heart for any possible scares.

Finally, with her heart pounding, she summoned her courage and pushed the door open forcefully.

None of the images she had imagined in her mind appeared. It was astonishingly quiet, with nothing strange or peculiar.

Seeing this, Annie couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

Everyone exchanged glances and slowly walked inside.

The interior of the door resembled the design of an ancient courtyard, with artificial hills, water pools, and numerous locust trees all around. In short, the style and design were all extremely eccentric.

Xiao Chen walked at the rear, and as soon as he stepped inside, the door behind him made a ‘pong’ sound, clanging shut. He wasn’t startled, on the contrary, it was Wang Xueke in front of him who was so frightened she nearly jumped. Everyone turned around in an instant.

What was even more alarming was that the moment the door closed, they all distinctly heard the sound of the iron chain outside being lifted by something and then locked up again!

The clinking of the iron chain struck at the hearts of everyone, sending shivers down their spines.

Zhao Junlu directly used his hands to pound at the door and even kicked it in the end, but the door remained unmoved and wouldn’t budge.

Su Lele’s face turned wan, and Duan Aoming held her in his arms. Her voice trembling, with a kind of belated fear, she asked, “We couldn’t have been locked inside, right?”

As soon as her words fell, everyone lapsed into eerie silence.

Du Chonghua’s feeling of dread certainly wasn’t smaller than everyone else, but he still managed to force a rigid smile, trying to boost everyone’s morale, “How could that be? We’re live streaming, if anything happens to us, our fans will call the police!”

It was like this one sentence from Du Chonghua had instantly reassured everyone.

Duan Aoming chimed in, “Right, exactly!”

[Four-Leaf Clover Hears the Wind: That’s easy to say, but if they really die, us calling the police will do a fart……

Don’t Forget Me Don’t Forget Me: I feel like Du Chonghua is acting strange, he’s giving me this sense of blind confidence…

Domineering CEO’s Little Darling: I thought Du Chonghua was the only one with a functioning brain in this group, never thought he could spit out something like this, really hard to put into words, tsk tsk tsk.

Flower Wreath Flower Crown: I don’t know why, but throughout this whole journey, the thing I’m most curious about isn’t the locust tree manor, but what the assistant looks like! Ahhhh! Curiosity killed the cat ah!

Sunflower: I’m curious too…why do I feel like he’s not ugly……]

“Visitors have arrived!” an elderly voice suddenly came from behind them, making anyone who heard the voice flinch.

The voice lacked any emotion, sounding like a machine directly reciting sentences, but its dry tone was like an echo from hell.

Not to mention the people present, even the fans watching the livestream trembled uncontrollably, some of them were so scared they almost dropped their phones.

[Panda Blood: Holy crap, that scared the heck out of me! Ahhhhhh.

I Really Don’t Want to Eat Snacks: Damn, that voice scared me so much I fell off my bed…

Gentle Breeze Bright Moon: I suddenly realize how reckless I am. I’m clearly terrified of ghosts, yet I’m watching this livestream at night. Not only that, but the more I watch, the more excited I get, now I’m hiding under my blankets shivering.]

The group stiffly turned around, the light from their phones moving with them. As they turned, their bodies couldn’t help but tremble, and their brains seemed to become congested.

How could there be anyone in such a haunted place?

The light from their phones pointed directly at the source of the voice, and a blurry figure slowly emerged from the darkness behind. With slow movements, there was something hitting the ground at irregular intervals, making a “thud thud thud” sound.

Finally, the person who spoke fully revealed themselves under everyone’s gaze. When they saw the person’s appearance, everyone, including the fans, felt a chill down their spine, hair standing on end.

The person who emerged was an elderly individual with a cane!

Du Chonghua, upon seeing that face, felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar. Cold sweat broke out on his inner palms, his face turned pale, and a wave of terror washed over him.

He definitely couldn’t mistake this person!

She was the elderly woman who had guided them during the day!

Hunched over, with a slight smile that seemed honest but was actually sycophantic, she looked directly at Xiao Chen, who stood at the back of the group.

“…………”

What was weird was that Xiao Chen actually understood the other party’s fawning smile.

“Are you the guests here for the banquet? Please come inside!” The old woman appeared serene and pointed with her cane towards the direction behind her.

She appeared like she was not the same person who had guided them during the day, her expression devoid of any fluctuation.

So, here was the question.

The group exchanged glances.

Should they go in or not?

When Xiao Chen heard the word “banquet,” his eyebrows twitched involuntarily. He had a peculiar feeling.







[ Snow White: What kind of divine unfolding is this, my goodness!

Do What You Want: Sh*t, it’s actually the small feet grandma who pointed us the way during the day! Ahh, it’s too terrifying! I’m getting goosebumps.

Freezing To Death: Oh no, oh no, I feel my scalp tingling, my heart’s racing too!

Fashion Designer: Wait a minute, drink wine, why should we drink wine? Suddenly, I had the image of emperors in ancient times giving poisoned wine.

White Peony: It can’t be. Why do I feel like this old lady doesn’t actually have any ill intentions towards anyone.. (Don’t hate if you don’t agree)

Light Blue: My intuition tells me that there’s a big conspiracy brewing! ]

Everyone was so scared that they went mute, and with no one daring to take a step forward, they all just looked at each other.

The old woman stood in place like a statue, cane in hand, with the curvature of her mouth frozen in place. Using her cane to point to the direction they came from, she indicated that they should go inside.

The two sides were deadlocked, and a long time passed without anyone moving.

Finally, the good-natured old lady retracted her smile and knocked her cane heavily on the ground.

Everyone in the room, except for Xiao Chen, quivered and dared not make a sound.

The woman’s white surfussed eyeballs rolled left and right. She sneered, and her originally benevolent face began to contort. Her voice became sharp and piercing as she threatened, “Don’t offer a toast and then not drink; if you toast, you must drink! Or you’ll face the consequences!”

It felt like in the next moment, she would transform into a ferocious beast, tear everyone present to pieces, and devour them.

People could even feel the air around them gradually change due to the old woman’s emotions. Breezes seemed to gather from nowhere, blowing stronger and stronger, lifting everyone’s hair and sending shivers down their spines.

Du Chonghua immediately understood the old woman’s intent and shouted loudly, “We’ll go! We’ll go!”

At that moment, everyone in the room turned to look at Du Chonghua.

Satisfied with his answer, the old woman nodded in approval. Her once grotesque expression returned to normal, the turbulent air gradually calming down. She pointed with her cane again and spoke in a seemingly benevolent tone, “Please proceed inside.”

Du Chonghua swallowed hard as the people around him exchanged glances. They reluctantly started in that direction, and like a group of timid mice, everyone remaining close together, slowly shifting.

Xiao Chen followed behind the group, calmly observing the surroundings. His intuition told him that he might have overlooked something.

The answer he had was on the tip of his tongue, but was stuck on the crucial part, leaving him pondering.

[ Fruit Lover: Damn, this old lady changes her expression way too quickly! Her whole face collapsed in an instant, and it snapped back just as quickly.

Little Yellow Duck: I’m really curious about what’s inside this old manor! I’m getting more and more nervous now!

GlamorousMakeup: Do you guys think this old lady will f*ck all the streamers over? Ahh, the more I think about it, the scarier it gets. ]

Under the old woman’s guidance, even with everyone nervous, they actually managed to proceed smoothly without any strange things popping up or terrifying echoing sounds. Everything seemed calm, as if it were nothing but a slightly aged old mansion.

They turned a corner, walked straight for a few meters, and passed through several doors, making their heads spin.

Finally, the old woman’s footsteps came to a halt.

Before everyone’s eyes was another courtyard.

What was special about it was how brightly it was lit, with rows and rows of hanging red lanterns.

In the center, there was a stage for singing, and beneath it was neatly arranged, elaborately carved, sandalwood tables and chairs.

The floor was padded with red carpet, and the tables were filled with delicious food and drinks, both meat and vegetarian, all beautifully presented.

Not only that, these dishes were also steaming hot, with the variety of food being extremely rich. Even a casual plate of side dishes displayed exceptional knife skills, undoubtedly meticulously crafted by someone.

What’s worth mentioning was that there were a total of seven chairs in the room, no more, no less, as if someone had known from the beginning that seven people would arrive.

Even Du Chonghua and the rest of the group were dumbfounded; not to mention their fans, with many exclaiming in shock and confusion.

[ Yam Brother: ??? Are they really here to eat and drink? Did I walk into the wrong set?

Not Thin Don’t Change Name: ??? My appetite suddenly increased a lot, this is so sinful, especially at this late hour!

Whining Ghost: Damn it, I want to eat too!

Kumquat Lemon Juice: I inexplicably feel a little sour.

Tears of the North Star: I was too naive, really! They said a banquet and there’s actually food and drinks!

Flamingo: Wait a minute, shouldn’t you peoples’ focus be on all those “double happiness” characters posted everywhere? And these red lanterns look so ominous! Is this a wedding?

I Can’t Draw Eyeliner: Just saying, I feel like the decorations kind of resemble a ghost wedding… ]

Not to mention everyone else, even Xiao Chen was a bit bewildered. He stood still and looked at the red double happiness characters on the windows, tied with red ribbons. Paired with these red lanterns, it really seemed like someone was about to get married, didn’t it?

Was all of this in the original movie’s plot?

The old woman scanned over everyone and flashed a friendly and satisfied smile. She calmly said, “Guests, please take your seats!”

The group exchanged glances, having just experienced many strange events, they didn’t dare defy the old woman’s wishes. They could only thicken their skin and reluctantly take their seats, each one doing so cautiously, fearing that something might go wrong.

Even Xiao Chen had a skeptical expression as he sat down. He glanced at the old woman multiple times, but she only responded with a mysterious and amiable smile.

“…………”

Xiao Chen became even more bewildered.

Once everyone sat down, a magical scene unfolded. The previously empty and desolate stage suddenly lit up, with two figures dressed in ancient costumes appearing out of thin air.

The two people on the stage wore thick and heavy makeup. Their appearances were concealed, but it still sent shivers down the spines of everyone in the room, causing them to break out in a cold sweat.

What was ominous was that their feet weren’t touching the ground; both of them were clearly hovering in mid-air!

These aren’t human beings; they’re clearly ghosts!

On the stage, both actors played male roles, with a distinct contrast. One played a slender and delicate-looking youth, while the other appeared to be a sturdy and robust man.

Everyone watched the two ghosts on the stage with puzzled expressions, confused as to what kind of performance they were about to give.

It was a rather chilling scene.

“What’s your name?” The man, dressed in military attire and mounted on a horse, looked at the youth who was kneeling on the ground, wearing tattered and dirty clothes.

“I am Han Manzi,” the youth replied, raising his head.

“Would you be willing to serve me in the future? I can promise you a future of wealth and prosperity,” the man asked.

The kneeling youth visibly hesitated, locking eyes with the man for a long moment before finally nodding.

Up to this point, the performance could still be considered somewhat normal, but in the next moment, the youth was suddenly lifted off the ground by the man and cradled in his arms like a princess. The plot started to take a rather abnormal turn.

“………???”

“………???”

The six people in the room could only start questioning life.

[ Swimming Circle: ???

Cheating Scammer: This, so they’re actually a pair of gays ?

Eat Less Move More: Oh my, this is very intense! ]

“This general’s name is Chen Qian, but you can call me Chen Zihua.” The man paused for a moment, then continued, “The name Han Manzi is too vulgar, unfit for the delicate and refined, so from now on, you shall be known as Han Zigao.”

[ Donut Cutie: I have to admit, this mysterious story is really intriguing. Despite all the layers of makeup applied on the actors, the plot is still quite captivating.

Pizza Guy: Holy cow, this plot, I love it. (Inner voice: Quick, make a move on him!) ]

“The fortune-teller said I have an emperor’s destiny. If I truly ascend the throne, I’ll make you my empress, and all the riches of the world will belong to you and me,” the man played with the youth’s hair.

The youth chuckled, “In ancient times, there were empresses, so there can be male empresses too. If you truly make me your empress, I won’t fear the gossip and rumors within this world.”

Xiao Chen had a numb expression on his face as he watched the two ghostly figures on the stage, performing in an overly exaggerated manner.

These two ghosts, relying solely on verbal dialogue and scene changes, casually changed into different outfits and performed the love story of Han Zigao and Chen Zihua from beginning to end.

They even ambiguously hinted at a grand harmony of life.

The performance was very stiff and rigid, to the point that it made him want to laugh.

[ Charger Not Charging: I knew this plot felt familiar. Isn’t this the historical Emperor Chen Wen and Han Zigao, whose probably the only male empress in history?

Time To Sleep: ???

My Face Is So Dry: Is this for real? I’m dumbfounded; it’s actually a true story with real people?

Craving For Meat: Don’t you guys know? Although Emperor Chen Wen only lived for 44 years, and didn’t rule for long before he fell ill and died. In the year following his death, Han Zigao was executed for rebellion only at the age of 30… ]

As the play concluded, the people in the room swallowed nervously. Not knowing what was coming next, their bodies were all tensed up.

The old woman just smiled, displaying a twisted and distorted smile. She opened her mouth and said, “The owner of our manor is getting married tonight and needs to choose a bride amongst you.”

After saying this, the old woman, perhaps to add a touch of intimidation, pulled out a spirit tablet from nowhere and held it in her hands.

“!”

Everyones’ eyes widened.

The old woman glanced over everyone, but her gaze landed squarely on Xiao Chen. She then revealed a sinister smile, obscuring her attempt to curry favor with the other.

“…………”

Hehehe.

[ Face Cream: Damn, it’s actually a ghost wedding?

Obedient Cutie: ??? Wait a minute, according to that play just now, this manor’s owner might have a not-so-normal sexual orientation, right?

Makeup Kit: I-I-I-I, I think it might be Du Chonghua…

Sunscreen Is Important: Why do I not find it scary at all? It’s actually a bit funny? ]

The old woman didn’t directly call out Xiao Chen’s name. Instead, she turned and placed the spirit tablet on the nearby table.

Calmly, she said, “Our master will choose another homeowner from all of you.”

The old woman paused, revealing a mysterious smile that was quite disturbing. Her features twisted slightly as she said, “Now you can pick up the teacups next to you. Whichever teacup contains tea leaves will be the new mistress of this manor.”

“…………”

Under the old woman’s eager gaze, Xiao Chen picked up the teacup beside him, slightly opened it, glanced inside, and then expressionlessly closed the lid.

Meanwhile, the six people next to him trembled as they reached for their teacups, their hearts pounding rapidly.

Hmm? It’s not me!




[ I Want To Eat Spicy Strips: Who in the world is it?

Dark Moon Strong Winds: I just rushed over from the next livestream room, it’s definitely not Du Chonghua or Zhao Junlu.

Be Slim Not Fat: Damn, it’s not Duan Aoming and Su Lele either!

Potato Chips Are So Delicious: No way, I watched Annie’s, but obviously, it’s not Wang Xueke either!

Duckbill hat:???? Then won’t all six of the people not be it?

Little Dinosaur: ????

Frog Prince: Speaking of which, did y’all forget about the assistant sitting in the corner?

Holding One’s Hand: !!! ]

The six people glanced at each other, neither confirming nor denying.

The old woman maintained a smile on her face. Her teeth were somewhat yellowed, and the gaps between her aging teeth had become quite large. When she opened her mouth, you could clearly see her teeth.

“Would the gentleman with tea leaves in his teacup please stand up.”

The hint made it quite obvious, it’s a male.

The boys looked at each other in shock, their eyes searching for confirmation.

Is it you?

No.

But it isn’t me either!

They communicated with each other through discreet gestures and small head movements, before reaching the conclusion that none of them were it!

“How is this possible?”

In an instant, everyones’ brain waves linked up and they collectively turned their gaze towards Xiao Chen, who was sitting in the corner.

Their expressions held not just disbelief but also a certain amount of schadenfreude.

After all, no one wanted to become the bride of a ghost. It’s said that humans and ghosts have different paths, separated by yin and yang, and being with a ghost could shorten one’s life!

Xiao Chen’s gaze appeared dignified, showing no signs of embarrassment. His expression was completely hidden, but hidden or not, it was evident that he was completely unfazed. He didn’t seem like someone who had been chosen at all!

Xiao Chen, seemingly oblivious to the attention, finally noticed everyone’s gaze. He pursed his lips, face stoic, and calmly said, “It’s not me either.”

“…………”

“…………”

The surroundings immediately fell into an eerie silence, and people quietly averted their gaze once more.

Except for Zhao Junlu, who had seen Xiao Chen’s true appearance, the thoughts of the others were all, “I knew it, how could it be him, such a ugly weirdo.”

[Towel: It isn’t the assistant? Then who else could it be?

Squirrel Showdown: There can’t be someone we can’t see sitting around, right;;

Frequent Hand Washing: I’m getting more and more confused by this inexplicable development. Is the domineering ghost trying to snatch a poor unsuspecting husband?

I Smell Delicious: Upstairs, here’s a pen, write it down for me!]

The old woman, after giving Xiao Chen a deep look, surprisingly didn’t expose his lie and continued without changing her expression, “It seems our master wants to observe a bit more. In that case, from today onwards, you’ll stay here.”

This statement was astonishing, sparking a wave of shock.

“……”

“……”

The six people once again exchanged bewildered glances, standing there, unsure if they should be terrifyingly or delightfully surprised .

The old woman picked up the spirit tablet again, and using her cane to support herself, she moved towards the same door through which she had entered. Her movements were neither fast nor slow. Before the others could fully react, she had already disappeared from their sight.

Xiao Chen, who had received the old woman’s benevolent gaze, remained seated in his original position, still expressionless.

When Du Chonghua saw the old woman leaving, he immediately got up from his chair to catch up with her.

He had many questions inside that he wanted to ask her.

However, when he attempted to step through the door, his head suddenly collided with something solid, and he was violently thrown back, as if struck by an invisible force.

With a “duong” sound, Du Chonghua felt his head spinning, stars spinning above his head. He was in severe pain.

Du Chonghua, left without a center of balance, was aggressively thrown to the ground.

A massive bump had formed on his forehead, and during the collision, his phone had slipped from his hand, crashing heavily onto the ground with a loud sound.

The onlookers were shocked.

Du Chonghua, struggling to stand up straight, tentatively reaching out to touch the invisible barrier that blocked his way. As soon as his hand made contact, he was shocked by an electric current, causing him to jump back.

Damn it!

They can’t leave now!

Tonight’s experience has shattered everyone’s understanding of the world, even the fans watching the livestream feel like all the years they spent studying were in vain. There were really ghosts in this damn world!

“Wh-what should we do now?” Annie said hesitatingly. She was terrified now, and realized she shouldn’t have come here. She would’ve been better off staying home and peacefully being an online influencer, easily earning tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands a month.

When Su Lele heard her words, she barked out a laugh, expressing her disdain and contempt.

Annie, upon hearing her laugh, felt her eyes welling up, not out of sadness but out of anger.

If it weren’t for Xiao Chen, she wouldn’t have made such a big fool of herself during her livestream. If it weren’t for Su Lele, her nose wouldn’t have broken, her face wouldn’t have contorted, and she wouldn’t have lost so many followers.

These two people, she wouldn’t let either of them go!

Weirdly, it was Zhao Junlu who went ahead and asked something that shouldn’t have been asked during that moment, “Can we eat the food on this table?”

Without waiting for confirmation or any reply, he simply sat down and started eating with big mouthfuls.

[Big Darling: Aaah, my son is so cute! Mommy loves you! What do you want to eat? Mommy will buy it all for you!

Meow: Ahahaha, Junlu is too cute. He must have been hungry for a while!

Sunflower: Tsk, at a time like this, you’re still thinking about eating. You might as well overeat and call it a day!

Sweet Tooth: Interrupting someone like this is quite impolite……]

Du Chonghua looked around the dimly lit environment with a perfectly square layout. After careful counting, there were eight rooms, with only one being the master bedroom, and the rest were side rooms.

After contemplating for a moment, he responded, “How about we search these rooms for clues first and see if it might be of any help to us?”

The others agreed with his suggestion.

“Um, you guys go ahead. I’ll eat a little bit more!” Zhao Junlu’s cheeks were puffed up, continuing to munch on food while speaking muffledly.

Du Chonghua rolled his eyes, feeling a surge of obscure anger but suppressed it. Finally, he spoke coldly, “Suit yourself.”

Xiao Chen glanced back at Zhao Junlu, who was eating whole heartedly. The corner of his mouth was lifted slightly, his phoenix eyes revealing a hint of amusement.

Heh.

He stoically left.

Everyone left to start searching for clues, and only thin back silhouettes were seen.

A strange glint flashed in Zhao Junlu’s eyes, and he spat out the food he had in his mouth.

His seat was right next to Xiao Chen. When he had checked the teacups for tea leaves, he had discreetly stolen a glance at Xiao Chen’s teacup.

Although he couldn’t be a hundred percent certain, he was at least sixty percent sure that he had seen something in Xiao Chen’s teacup!

With that trail of thought, Zhao Junlu’s expression became slightly twisted and displayed a hint of craziness.

He couldn’t stand Xiao Chen, who let him have that cursed face! He deserved to stay here and marry the ghost!

Zhao Junlu’s phone was placed flat on the table. The fans in the livestream room couldn’t see his expression, so they had no idea what he was up to.

He gently grasped the top of Xiao Chen’s teacup lid, with a smug expression as though he was sure of his victory, opened the cup, only to end up standing there foolishly.

F*ck, there was nothing there!

How could this be.

Zhao Junlu’s eyes were wide open, seemingly bloodshot, as if he was about to pop his eyeballs out.

He stood up again and started inspecting the tea sets of the other people, but the result was the same without exception.

Once Zhao Junlu received the confirmation, he couldn’t believe it and sat back in his original seat, grinding his teeth.

It was actually all true!

Zhao Junlu, who was lost in his own turbulent feelings, failed to notice that his ears, eyes, and nose had inexplicably begun to bleed, with the bleeding becoming increasingly severe.

The neatly arranged aromatic dishes on the table instantly turned rotten, covered in a thick layer of mold and emitting a foul smell.

A dark, sinister gas emanated off of Zhao Junlu.

[Worldly Traveler: ?? Why is Junlu not talking and being so silent?

Like a Dream: I have a bad feeling about this…]

Du Chonghua carefully pushed open the wooden door of the master bedroom, possibly still traumatized by his earlier incident. He was extremely cautious, confirming multiple times for any invisible barriers, before finally extending his leg to step inside.

Xiao Chen, as usual, followed behind as the last person.

As soon as he took a step forward, he could clearly feel something caressing his thigh/groin area, with an extremely gentle touch and hints of something inexplicit.

“………”

Xiao Chen revealed a faint smile, and when no one was paying attention, he slightly bent his waist and reached his hand out to directly stop the culprit that was teasing him continuously.

He whispered, “Don’t fuss.”

His tone was both indulgent and gentle, showing no signs of rejection.

It was evident that the entity didn’t intend to let him off so easily. After being prohibited from touching that part, it slowly moved upward, and caressed the young man’s slender waist instead.

Xiao Chen could even hear the man’s panting as his lips brushed against his earlobe.

“………” Xiao Chen suddenly wanted to laugh but managed to suppress it, avoiding any slip-ups.

The man didn’t pester him for long, and soon Xiao Chen felt the harassment disappear. However, just before leaving, he also imprinted a light kiss on his lips.

The room’s layout was the same as the courtyard, adorned with red ribbons, red lanterns, red candles, and red “Double Happiness” symbols, exuding a festive atmosphere.

As soon as they entered, the group could sense an extreme opulence and the scent of money in the air.

The room was large and filled with numerous antiques and calligraphy pieces. Those with knowledge, like Du Chonghua, could tell at a glance that even the random objects in the room were made of real gold and silver, adorned with jade and precious gemstones.

However, the group had only taken a couple of steps into the room before suddenly freezing in their tracks. They exchanged glances, their hearts filled with fear and trepidation.

That spirit tablet laying on the table, isn’t that the one that the old woman had just taken away?

How could it appear here?

Wait a minute!

If that was the case, wasn’t this room the room of the owner of this old manor?

As soon as that thought crossed their minds, a chill ran down their spines, and their scalps began to tingle as if they were in an ice-cold cellar.

Before they could even fully realize the danger and hurriedly make their escape, the wide-open wooden door was abruptly shut by an unexpected gust of wind, accompanied by a loud bang, sealing them inside.

F*ck.





“Crap,” Du Chonghua cursed aloud.

Before these people could make any moves, the red candles in the room went out, instantly plunging the room into eerie darkness.

This darkness made it impossible for any of them to see their surroundings clearly. It gave them the surreal sensation of being in a world beyond, their footsteps feeling light and airy.

Wang Xue happened to be standing beside Xiao Chen, and as the lights went out, she instinctively grabbed Xiao Chen’s elbow, hiding behind him.

Part of the reason for this might be because when everyone was left in the dark, only Xiao Chen reached out to help, making her more willing to trust him compared to the others.

“………” Xiao Chen was speechless.

“………” A certain someone was also speechless.

Heh.

[ Don’t Want To Attend Online Class: Why is the screen black?

Want To Sleep In Every Day: The neighboring live stream is also black!

Dr. Martens Boots Should Be Paired With Slender Legs: F*ck! This is making me a bit anxious!

Pigeon King: Wait a moment, wait a moment, look, the screen’s brightening back up!

Sugar Daddy: The image quality is strange, like that special camera that can see the surroundings clearly at night.

Makeup Kit: That’s not right, this angle looks really high, like God’s perspective. Isn’t someone livestreaming with a smartphone?

Weight Scale: The screens in the neighboring rooms are all showing the same image, the same angle, and the same effect!

Did You Eat Less Today: Not entirely, Zhao Junlu’s live stream doesn’t have this issue, does it?

Rowing Against The Current: Speaking of which, Zhao Junlu hasn’t said a word for almost ten minutes, and he hasn’t touched his phone. I wonder what he’s doing… ]

Everyone, except for Du Chonghua, whose phone was shattered from being knocked away, immediately thought of taking out their phones and turning on the flashlight right away.

But strangely, their phones seemed to have simultaneously run out of battery, and no matter how they pressed the power button, they couldn’t get them to light up.

They couldn’t even turn on their phones, let alone the flashlight. Their phones were completely dead!

The fear-stricken Su Lele dove into Duan Aoming’s arms, who as her boyfriend, immediately patted her head to comfort her.

Annie also instinctively reached out and grabbed the hem of Du Chonghua’s clothes, who was closest to her.

With their phones out of power, live streaming was impossible, so no one knew what was happening here. There was no need to maintain their online personas.

With this thought in mind, Du Chonghua was very ruthless. Furrowing his brows, he forcefully pushed Annie away.

“Get lost, don’t touch me!”

[ Notebook Hard Drive: ?? Why is Du Chonghua so violent? After all, Annie is still a girl, right?

I Want To Confess: Although I dislike Annie, the way Du Chonghua pushed her makes me have a much lower opinion of him;

Balloon Tower Defense: Annie acts so annoying, it’s normal for Du Chonghua to not tolerate her. She’s been dragging the squad’s hind leg this whole time! ]

Annie was a bit dazed when she was pushed away, her whole body flying back. Due to the darkness, those present couldn’t see Annie’s unfortunate state as she was flung away. They only heard a loud “duang” sound.

However, Xiao Chen could clearly see everything around him. He watched Annie’s face hit the ground, like a frog in a mid-leap position , crashing straight onto the floor.

The scene was quite comical and amusing.

A faint smile played on Xiao Chen’s lips, almost making him laugh out loud.

Annie struggled to get up from the ground, trembling with anger.

When the little death squad was first established, she had the highest reputation and the most fans. Everyone, including Du Chonghua, showed her all sorts of care, flattery, and dependence on her popularity. This popularity slowly helped each of them become famous.

As a result, while she collapsed, their popularity had risen one by one. Now that she looked at their expressions, it was truly chilling.

She gritted her teeth and clenched her fists, a hint of malice flashing in her eyes.

I won’t let any of you get away with this!

“Duang duang duang”

There was a sudden, earth-shattering noise as if something was scraping against the ground, constantly moving and emitting a piercing and sharp sound.

Du Chonghua furrowed his brow and listened carefully to the sound’s source.

Listening attentively, based on his rough judgment, he was almost certain that the source of the sound was in the room where the wedding bed was.

The next moment, his guess was confirmed.

The headboard of the wedding bed, originally covered with a big red wedding quilt, turned into a gaping abyssal hole. Inexplicably, the red candle at the head of the bed was lit, and the faint light in the room allowed people to see their surroundings more clearly.

Du Chonghua and Duan Aoming exchanged glances. Duan Aoming patted Su Lele’s hand to reassure her, and the two of them cautiously walked over, taking small, cautious steps, afraid of bumping into something unseen.

Duan Aoming walked to the side of the headboard, stretched out his head, wanting to see what lay beneath the cracked boards.

A single glance, combined with the absence of lighting in that area, made it seem unfathomably dark.

Moreover, the shape of the opened headboard was extremely peculiar, with a small, round entrance that resembled a well. Getting close to it sent shivers down the spine.

So, here was the question: should they go inside?

Even with a light source, Wang Xueke continued to cling tightly to Xiao Chen’s elbow. She refused to let go, nervously swallowing hard.

Xiao Chen looked at her with an expressionless face, said nothing, and silently lit her a candle in his heart.

The next moment, Wang Xueke felt an inexplicable sense of dread wash over her. Even her breathing involuntarily quickened. It felt like something ice-cold was enveloping her entire body, like a sharp blade that threatened to cut through her skin and flesh.

She fearfully clutched Xiao Chen’s hand tighter.

“………”

Heh.

“Should we go in?” Duan Aoming asked Du Chonghua with a serious expression.

Du Chonghua fell silent for a moment and eventually nodded.

Right now, they had no other choice.

“Who goes first?” Duan Aoming asked again, looking at Du Chonghua. But this time, Du Chonghua’s gaze seemed evasive.

Du Chonghua, who had always been at the forefront of the team, was now hesitating.

To be honest, he valued his life greatly, and if it weren’t for maintaining his big brother persona in front of the camera, he wouldn’t have to live so exhaustingly.

Duan Aoming understood his reluctance and wasn’t angry. He directly said, “I’ll go then.”

Duan Aoming picked up the red candle placed nearby, reached in the hole and examined the depth inside. He held the candle’s body between his teeth, and slowly slid down the bed frame, holding onto it with both hands.

Those above only heard a scraping sound, followed by the thud of someone hitting the ground.

After a while, Duan Aoming’s muffled voice echoed, “There’s a path here. You can come down, I’ll catch you.”

[Eat and Drink Enough: I don’t know why, I feel like Duan Aoming is so understanding. He’s always been quiet, but when it comes to doing things, he’s all-around and considerate!

Holy Mary: I’ve actually been curious on who’s running the livestream. The camera angle keeps changing automatically, just like watching a movie.

Rose Girl: Why does Du Chonghua give me increasingly weird vibes? He wasn’t like this before, right?]

Below was a narrow corridor, just about the height of a person, and very narrow, no way for two people to walk together side by side.

Duan Aoming raised the candle and examined the walls around him, his pupils slightly contracting. He exclaimed, “There are drawings on the walls!”

Du Chonghua raised an eyebrow at his words and immediately moved closer to take a look.

Wang Xueke, Su Lele, and Annie all turned, looking over with curiosity.

Xiao Chen had an unsettling premonition, though he couldn’t quite place it.

[Kart Racing: Hahaha, did you see that? Duan Aoming’s face turned as red as a lobster. I’m dying of laughter! Hahaha.

Colored Contacts Hurt Eyes: Hahaha, Duan Aoming was initially excited, calling others to see the drawings, looking like a model student. Who would have thought the drawings on the wall were ghs ??

Red Elephant: It’s too funny! Hahaha, Duan Aoming must be so embarrassed!

Little Motorcycle: The funniest part is that the drawings aren’t even male and female; they’re two guys! Hahaha.

Goose Goose Goose: I can’t, I’m laughing too hard! Hahahaha!]

After patiently waiting for his turn to see the wall painting, Xiao Chen finally saw what was on it. His face instantly turned pale, and he looked like he had been punched in the gut. Fortunately, he was wearing a mask, so others couldn’t see his expression.

He took a deep breath and forced a fake smile.

The next moment, he felt something touching his hair, as if trying to soothe his emotions and appease him.

Heh heh.

Xiao Chen inwardly cursed, pretending to absentmindedly touch his hair. Then, he slapped the intrusive, wandering hand without any mercy.

How could he not recognize the people depicted on the wall?

The one below had phoenix eyes and a snake coiled around a rose tattoo on his back.

The one above had gray eyes, long hair, and was dressed in red.

Although the paintings were not realistic, how could he not recognize them from back then?

Wasn’t it him and Jing He?

This horny old man!

Shameless!

What’s even more terrifying was that this corridor didn’t only contain the one painting they just saw. In just a few minutes of walking, they’ve come across nearly a hundred paintings. While the main characters remain the same, their positions were bizarre and diverse.

It was unclear if the artist had retained a semblance of sanity or not, but the most crucial parts were left unillustrated. Instead, they skillfully used elements like roses, clothing, and ribbons to obscure them, leaving plenty of room for imagination.

The group’s expressions gradually transformed from the initial astonishment and embarrassment to nonchalance. They went from covering their faces in embarrassment and stealing glances to openly admiring the paintings on the walls.

Girls tend to have more imaginative thoughts than boys, but even they found it somewhat surprising that the positions of two individuals could be so diverse.

Even Xiao Chen, as one of the subjects, couldn’t help but widen his eyes, face red.

When had he ever made such embarrassing moves?

This isn’t me!

[ Peggy: It’s like I just attended a physiology class…

Baldy Qiang : I have to say, the owner of this house is really quite the…enthusiast.

Patrick Star: As a girl, I honestly don’t know why I’m finding this so intriguing…

Little Sister: I think I’m gaining knowledge!

Remote Control: As the fellow sex, I’ve also learned quite a bit.

Dodo Dodo: Upstairs, please share your experiences!!! ]




As the group proceeded through the corridor, the dim candlelight allowed them to see the scene before them more clearly.

Everyone instinctively froze in their tracks and gulped.

The interior was incredibly spacious, exuding an otherworldly and ethereal feeling that seemed very unhumanly. Looking up, all they could see was darkness. They were no longer surrounded by narrow walls but rather solid stone blocks, each one layered on top of another, creating the visual effect of climbing upwards.

It was also very bright here. There were no lamps or candles, but this enclosed space still appeared as bright as daylight.

What truly left them rooted in place, however, was not the vastness of the place but the fact that it was filled with human corpses, piled up like mountains. The height of the pile was even greater than the combined height of two adult men.

Most of these bodies had already decomposed into white bones, with just a few that still had rotten flesh on their faces. The putrid smell of decaying bodies permeated the air.

It was a sickening sight.

It was easy for the group to imagine and empathize, to the point of wondering if their own fate might be similar. These thoughts amplified their horror.

Annie looked at the horrifying scene and couldn’t help but feel sick. She eventually couldn’t bear it any longer, took off her mask, then proceeded to retch dramatically at the sight, to the point where it seemed she wanted to vomit out stomach acid.

But she forgot, she was no longer the beautiful Annie she used to be. Her nose had collapsed, her face was now asymmetrical, and there was even some inexplicable swelling and stiffness in what was once full and rosy cheeks.

[So Cute: Anne’s face, even if you were mentally prepared to see it, still looks unbearably ugly…

Ring Madness: No, this face is too hideous, can’t stand it, it’s a turn-off!]

Su Lele and Wang Xueke didn’t look too well either, their faces pale white. Duan Aoming took a deep breath and comforted Su Lele by holding her in his arms.

Wang Xueke, as usual, hid behind Xiao Chen. She covered the position of her heart with her hands, only then easing her agitation.

Annie seemed to realize her own extreme ugliness and, being someone who loved beauty, she disregarded everything and screeched without restraint.

The next moment, her expression turned even more hateful. She glared at Su Lele, who had a boyfriend to protect her. Su Lele coldly chuckled and rolled her eyes at Anne’s current predicament.

Du Chonghua stood where he was and listened to Anne’s unseemly screams. These screams made him, who was already anxious, even more agitated. His eyes were bloodshot, and his eyeballs almost popped out.

He rushed forward. Pressing down Annie’s struggling body, he threatened, “If you don’t behave, believe me or not, I will leave you alone in this godforsaken place.”

Anne trembled all over, tears streaming down her face. If she was her former self, she would have presented a devastating scene of a weeping, delicate, and pitiable maiden. However, with this kind of face, even Du Chonghua found it somewhat repulsive; gazing at her only made him more irritable.

Threatened, Anne finally complied. She stopped screaming and struggling. In fact, due to Du Chonghua’s threat, her mind cleared up slightly. Her knees gave way, and she knelt in place.

Du Chonghua glanced at her but couldn’t be bothered paying her any attention.

“Stubborn are we?” Someone whispered a devilish incantation in her ear, though it wasn’t clear who.

Annie shuddered, and since nobody cared about her well-being, nobody noticed that something seemed amiss with her.

The person continued to whisper to her with an ethereal, seductive voice.

“Do you hate them?” Saying this, they emitted a sharp laugh.

Anne clenched her teeth, and without warning her neck pulse suddenly twitched.

Hate!

How could she not hate?

Annie widened her eyes, and without a word, her gaze frozen in place, as if lost in thought about something. The sparkle in her eyes disappeared.

She appeared lifeless, like a motionless marionette, stiff and wooden.

However, Xiao Chen keenly noticed this scene. He glanced at Anne, curved his mouth into a smile, and discreetly stepped back, moving to the rear of the group.

[Be A Little Fairy: Quick, look at Anne’s expression; it’s giving me the creeps!

Dry Brushing Helps Weight Loss: Seeing her like that feels oddly unsettling…

Band-Aid: Oh my, her face looks scarier than the ghosts I see in horror movies!]

Du Chonghua was considering whether to continue forward and check for any new discoveries.

Annie, who had been crouching on the ground, suddenly raised her head and swiftly stood up.

The sound of her getting up was quite loud, and everyone turned to look at her with expressions of hateful disdain.

The next second, while Du Chonghua was still somewhat dazed, Annie, seemingly from nowhere, produced a dagger and lunged at him. She plunged the knife straight into his abdomen, immediately drawing blood.

“Ahhhhhhhhh!”

“Ahhhhhh–”

Su Lele and Wang Xueke screamed simultaneously, horror painted all over their faces.

Duan Aoming was standing very close to Du Chonghua, and he could be assumed to have the best angle of witnessing Du Chonghua being stabbed. He even heard the distinct sound of the dagger piercing through flesh and skin.

In almost an instant, although their minds had not yet recovered from the shock, their bodies reacted reflexively, and they all bolted in the direction they had come from as if they had gone mad.

Duan Aoming staggered a few steps and nearly collapsed from shock.

At this moment, none of them thought about rushing forward to help Du Chonghua.

Xiao Chen, on the other hand, remained in place without moving, as though everything had unfolded as he anticipated. He watched all of this with a cold gaze.

He glanced at the fleeing group and then turned to look at Annie.

Just seconds later, someone leaned in close to his ear. With a slightly indulgent tone, they said, “Naughty.”

Xiao Chen rubbed his burning red ears and muttered another curse under his breath.

Annie had already pulled the dagger out of Du Chonghua’s abdomen, and had blood splattered all over her face. It slowly slid down from her eyelids, down to her neck, giving her a horrifying and malevolent expression.

Du Chonghua stared wide-eyed with bulging eyeballs and veins standing out on his face. He clutched his abdomen, as if he hadn’t yet recovered from the sudden shock. His hand trembled as blood uncontrollably flowed and pooled on the ground.

Finally, he snapped out of his daze. His eyes widened, features contorted. He pressed one hand against his chest, using the other to try and grab Annie’s hand holding the knife, intending to face this deranged woman in a life-or-death struggle.

But for some reason, Annie was unexpectedly strong. Du Chonghua’s resistance was feeble before her, and his struggles seemed to only further infuriate her.

Annie kicked Du Chonghua’s knee, causing him to collapse to the ground, unsteady, like a lamb ready for slaughter, devoid of any resistance.

The hand Annie used to hold the knife continued to relentlessly stab Du Chonghua’s abdomen, puncturing and withdrawing repeatedly. Blood followed her every motion, spattering more and more, with some even sprayed directly into her eyes.

Yet at this moment, she felt no fatigue or discomfort. She appeared completely irrational, like a female demon gone mad, even cracking a wide, maniacal grin.

Go die! Perish!

Finally, Du Chonghua completely lost consciousness. Before dying, his eyes remained open, pupils shrunk as he gazed intensely at Annie. It was as if even in death, he wouldn’t let her escape.

Anne, however, showed no mercy, continuing her frenzied stabbing with the dagger.

Seemingly tireless and unrelenting, she didn’t even stop when Du Chonghua’s body began to cool. She continued to stab his abdomen, even if she had already exposed his internal organs. There was no sign of her stopping.

Go die! Perish!

[Tired To Death: What’s happening? Why did Anne suddenly jump up from the ground, and the screen went black again?

Don’t Force Me: I have a bad feeling about this; I just sense Anne is up to something.

Hourglass Figure: Before the screen went black, Anne’s final expression was so unsettling!

Single And fabulous, Do Not Disturb: Damn, that scared me! I’m not watching anymore! I’m going to sleep! My god!]

Wang Xueke and the other two ran for a good while before realizing that no one was chasing them. They were so fast not even Xiao Chen had caught up with their pace.

But at this moment, their primary concern was how to stay alive!

“What do we do? What do we do? What should we do?” Wang Xueke trembled all over, looking at the only male companion in their current group, Duan Aoming, seemingly placing all her hopes on him.

Duan Aoming’s face turned pale, looking extremely distressed. He shook his head, his legs trembling as if he had been deeply shocked, completely devoid of any masculine demeanor.

In comparison, Su Lele remained exceptionally silent, not saying a word from start to finish. She kept her head down, lost in thought.

Duan Aoming’s mind was in a whirl, appearing disoriented, thoughts seeming fragmented. Seeing Wang Xueke continually asking him, he finally broke down, his expression on the verge of tears, stuttering and in a state of panic, he said, “I don’t know! I really don’t know!”

Just moments ago, they had jumped down from the room above, which was a considerable height, with no staircase to climb back up.

They were indeed trapped in an impossible situation.

Beside them, Su Lele clenched her teeth. Eyes flashing with determination, she said fiercely, “Did you bring a knife?!”

Duan Aoming and Wang Xueke looked at her with a mix of understanding and confusion.

After a brief silence, Wang Xueke, with her body trembling, hesitated for a moment before finally speaking, “I, I brought one.”

After all, they had come for exploration and to challenge a haunted house. As a girl, she would always carry a knife with her every time she ventured out with the little death squad, just as a precaution.

Duan Aoming widened his eyes, looking at Wang Xueke in disbelief, as if he hadn’t expected this at all.

Su Lele, on the other hand, smiled again, her voice calm and composed. It was a smile that would send shivers down someone’s spine, a smile that made people think deeply and feel a sense of dread. She said, “I brought one too.”

Duan Aoming shuddered all over, a look of horror in his eyes as he gazed at her. It was as if he was seeing Su Lele for the first time. Chills ran down his spine, causing him to break out in a cold sweat.

The atmosphere immediately fell into a brief yet eerie silence.

“So, let’s go back,” Su Lele broke the eerie silence. Her eyes flashed with an unreadable light.

For once, no one argued with her.

After hesitating for a while, Wang Xueke, trembling but resolute, nodded in agreement.

After all, no one would ever know! They were just doing it to survive! Yes, that’s right.

In this world, the most unpredictable beings are women. If a woman sets her mind to something, there’s no way of fathoming what she might do.




Xiao Chen indifferently stood in place, coldly watching Annie, who was still acting crazily, with no indication to stop her.

Before long, Xiao Chen heard the faint sound of footsteps coming from behind.

The group of people turned and came back.

Xiao Chen didn’t feel surprised, and didn’t even bother turning his head.

Wang Xueke ran out of the dark corridor and immediately noticed how Xiao Chen was still standing in the same spot, motionless, with no signs of fear or evasion, which was quite incredible.

Besides surprise, her gaze was also filled with suspicion.

The look in her eyes was no longer as pure as it initially was.

Like Wang Xueke, Su Lele also clearly noticed this scene. She narrowed her eyes slightly, her expression changing unpredictably.

However, the most important thing at the moment was to deal with the threat of Annie’s presence.

Duan Aoming couldn’t bear to look at the newly mangled corpse on the ground. He felt sick to his stomach, extremely uncomfortable.

When Annie, who had originally been single-mindedly attacking Du Chonghua, saw the sudden appearance of Su Lele, her attention shifted and her initially lifeless eyes focused again.

She pulled the knife out of Du Chonghua’s body with a sinister chuckle and then crawled up from the ground.

When she got up, her brain suddenly experienced a rush of blood, causing her to stumble a couple of steps and almost fall.

At this moment, Annie had completely lost her humanity, resembling a remorseless demon who would kill without hesitation.

An image of Su Lele dead, with both her eyes wide open and unblinking, had been conjured in Annie’s mind, further fueling her murderous desires. She held the dagger and lunged towards Su Lele without hesitation.

Go to hell, you wretched woman!

However, this time everyone was prepared, not to mention how they outnumbered her three to one.

As Annie charged forward, Su Lele swiftly dodged her, taking advantage of the continued momentum Annie had from jumping at her. Without any hesitation, Su Lele viciously stabbed her personal mini knife into Anne’s lower back and quickly withdrew it.

Anne staggered, her expression momentarily blank, as if she hadn’t realized what had just happened. She looked behind herself, and blood was already gushing uncontrollably.

Finally, her expression changed, turning into that of an enraged lion. She immediately resumed her attack on Su Lele, as if the previous stab hadn’t inflicted much damage on her.

Su Lele kept evading, clearly at a disadvantage.

Duan Aoming was beside her, and at some point had magically retrieved a metal rod from who knows god where. He seized the opportunity to charge towards Annie, aiming at her head. He ruthlessly swung the rod without hesitation.

Annie immediately collapsed from the blow, and as she fell, her body began to convulse uncontrollably. The back of her head had been struck with such force that it created a hole, from which blood gushed uncontrollably.

The dagger Annie had been holding slipped from her hand and fell to the ground. She reached out several times to grab it, but her movements were feeble.

Seeing this, Su Lele rushed forward and used her foot to kick the dagger away, sending it flying far away. Anne lay on the ground, her face covered in blood, features contorted. She looked towards Su Lele.

Su Lele immediately kicked her again, muttering angrily, “You’re so ugly, yet you still have the nerve to glare at me!”

Each of Su Lele’s kicks was merciless, delivered with all her strength. Her expression was twisted; venting her anger, she completely lost her rationality.

“You want to kill me, huh? Come on! You wretched dog! Go to hell!”

Her boyfriend, Duan Aoming, was once again stunned. He was with her for the whole day, yet now he stood there frozen, too afraid to move.

Meanwhile, Xiao Chen, who had been watching this entertaining spectacle from the sidelines, silently curled up the corners of his mouth.

After Su Lele had kicked Annie to her heart’s content, Annie was left with only her last breath. She could only lie on the ground with slight convulsions, foaming at the mouth.

Su Lele’s gaze directly turned towards a trembling Wang Xueke, who was standing on the side, holding a knife.

As soon as Wang Xueke locked eyes with her, she looked like a startled rabbit, nearly jumping up, her face filled with fear.

Su Lele let out a cold laugh and said, “Come here!”

Wang Xueke dared not move and stood frozen in place. However, Su Lele seemed to have had enough and, with her foot leaving Anne’s face, she rushed over to confront Wang Xueke.

Wang Xueke was trembling. With her spirit shattered, tears streamed uncontrollably from her eyes.

Su Lele grabbed her hair like she was holding onto a dog and dragged her over to the nearly lifeless Annie.

Wang Xueke’s eyes met Annie’s, which were full of hatred, disgust, and despair. Her body trembled even more violently.

Su Lele smirked and ordered, “Kill her!”

Wang Xueke suddenly lifted her head, her whole body frozen in place, indecisive.

Seeing her lack of action, Su Lele slapped her across the face, leaving an immediate red mark. She yelled, “Kill her for me!”

Wang Xueke cried even louder, her body convulsing, still too afraid to move.

Su Lele kicked Wang Xueke in the body, causing her to collapse to the ground.

Grabbing her by the hair, she sneered, “If you don’t kill her, you might as well die too!”

Upon hearing this, Wang Xueke’s eyes widened, and her mind instantly cleared. She nodded rapidly, almost shaking her head off with the speed.

Su Lele released her grip on Wang Xueke’s hair with satisfaction.

Wang Xueke got up from the ground, holding the knife, and slowly approached Annie.

Annie had not yet passed away and was still breathing faintly, gasping for air.

Wang Xueke’s hand trembled, her heart raced, and tears streameddown her face. However, she did not hesitate, directly stabbing Annie in the heart.

One deadly blow, and Annie immediately stopped breathing.

Wang Xueke’s body went limp and slumped to the ground. Then, she started sobbing softly.

She had actually taken a life!

Su Lele didn’t have time to deal with the now broken Wang Xueke.

She narrowed her eyes.

In comparison, who she wanted to deal with now was Xiao Chen!

Xiao Chen’s face was hidden behind a mask, making it impossible to discern his expression. It was unclear what he was thinking.

Su Lele slowly walked back to Duan Aoming. When this man saw her approaching, he instinctively stepped back.

Observing his reaction, Su Lele slightly squinted her eyes, a glimmer of understanding in her gaze.

She had seen through this man a long time ago; he was a coward without a backbone in critical situations.

Despite Duan Aoming’s resistance written all over him, Su Lele still approached and embraced his waist.

He froze in place, unable to move, overwhelmed by fear.

Su Lele rested her head on Duan Aoming’s shoulder, and her actions were very affectionate. However, the words that came out of her mouth the next moment were malicious and fierce. “Kill Xiao Chen!”

Duan Aoming shivered again, too afraid to move.

“We are like grasshoppers on the same string now. We three killed Annie, but Xiao Chen hasn’t done anything. If he doesn’t die, we won’t survive!”

Duan Aoming’s lips turned pale, but he didn’t say a word in response to Su Lele’s demand.

Su Lele patted his stiff shoulder with satisfaction, then smiled, her voice extremely soft, “Am I right, darling?”

The term “darling” was what Su Lele often called him in private, and Duan Aoming usually enjoyed hearing it.

But at this moment, hearing her say it gave him a chilling feeling.

Su Lele released her grip on Duan Aoming’s waist, turned around, and locked eyes with Xiao Chen.

Xiao Chen gazed back at her calmly and took the initiative to speak, stating the facts calmly, “You want to kill me.”

Su Lele smiled without confirming or denying it.

Xiao Chen shifted his gaze away from her and instead looked at Duan Aoming, who was standing behind her. He spoke indifferently, “Do you think that if she kills me, she will spare you?”

Duan Aoming remained frozen in place.

Truth be told, this was his current dilemma. His gaze was somewhat evasive, and he remained silent.

In his eyes, she used to be a bit spoiled and would throw tantrums at most. Where did this behavior today come from?

She had shattered his previous perception of her time and time again!

Shivers went down his spine.

Su Lele sensed Duan Aoming’s wavering and immediately, in a show of vulnerability, embraced his waist, softly sobbing, “Isn’t my current state all because of Annie’s pressure? Don’t you remember how I used to be? Have you forgotten, darling?”

Duan Aoming’s heart softened, and he reciprocated by hugging Su Lele’s waist.

Indeed, Su Lele was his pampered little princess, and he saw her every day. How could he forget what she used to be like?

With this realization, he felt a twinge of guilt, surprised by the unwelcoming thoughts he harbored of her in his mind.

Su Lele buried her head in his chest and, in a hidden corner where he couldn’t see, curled the corners of her mouth. She held Duan Aoming tightly, while her fingers moved upward slowly.

The next moment, Duan Aoming’s pupils suddenly constricted, and he looked at Su Lele with a mixture of disbelief.

Su Lele, with an emotionless expression, withdrew the knife that had been plunged into Duan Aoming’s back. His blood sprayed out in spurts.

Duan Aoming staggered and took a couple of unsteady steps before collapsing. He died with a look of disbelief, gazing up at Su Lele’s unemotional eyes.

Seemingly asking, why?

Su Lele stared at Duan Aoming’s lifeless body with a calm demeanor, showing indifference.

On the other hand, Wang Xueke was completely stunned, huddled in a corner with a knife in her hand, tears and snot streaming down her face, trembling all over.

Su Lele maintained a calm gaze as she looked at Xiao Chen and smiled, “How about this: you kill Wang Xueke, and we both escape from this together.”

Upon hearing her suggestion, Xiao Chen didn’t immediately refute it. Instead, he lowered his gaze in contemplation, as if he were considering the feasibility of the idea.

Wang Xueke, on the side, widened her eyes and began to sob uncontrollably, as if she had given up all hope of resisting.

Seeing Xiao Chen’s contemplative expression, Su Lele assumed that he agreed to her proposal. She was about to say something when Xiao Chen lifted his head and calmly responded, “Please allow me to decline.”

“You!” Su Lele was frustrated.

Xiao Chen smiled and said, “Don’t you think it’s more advantageous for me to kill you than to kill Wang Xueke?”

Xiao Chen took a step, slowly approaching Su Lele, who stared at him with wide eyes.

Xiao Chen’s lips curved, and he calmly said, “You want to kill me! There’s someone who might disagree!”

Su Lele didn’t understand and furrowed her brows.

In the next instant, a figure in red materialized behind Xiao Chen seemingly out of thin air.

A man with a chilling presence stood behind Xiao Chen, his gray eyes completely emotionless, staring coldly at Su Lele.

Su Lele felt a chill running down her spine, recognizing him instantly.

It was the man from the painting on the corridor wall!




Su Lele felt a wave of absurdity.

She recalled everything she had experienced since entering this manor.

The owner of the mansion, with gray eyes, the same-sex-related murals, the desire to find his bride…

One by one, one thing after another, reappeared in her mind and then formed a complete line, connecting everything. A clear answer emerged.

Su Lele felt like a joke, a toy for others to play with.

Xiao Chen was the other owner of this manor!

She trembled in anger. Her expression twisted grotesquely, and her face began to twitch.

Damn it!

There’s no way she would survive this! Xiao Chen would never let her go!

With this thought, her legs gave way, and she collapsed onto her knees.

She looked up to the sky and let out a sharp laughter. Mixed with a sense of self-deprecation and self-pity, it was extremely harsh and piercing. These few sounds of laughter, like a howl, evoked pity in people.

Finally, Su Lele lowered her head and her gaze became indifferent. She regained her composure, saying, “Go ahead and kill me.”

The man raised an eyebrow but didn’t say a word. Instead, he squinted his eyes, his gray eyes remaining calm.

Xiao Chen turned his head and exchanged a smile with the man.

Wang Xueke, who was nearby, seemed to watch the scene with confusion and astonishment. She was puzzled and somewhat frightened by the sudden appearance of the man next to Xiao Chen, and their intimate interactions.

The man glared at Wang Xueke, who immediately fell silent and dared not move.

Jing Hezhi embraced Xiao Chen’s waist and curled his lips.

The next moment, the two of them both disappeared from the spot.

Wang Xueke opened her mouth and was about to say something.

Suddenly, her head began to throb intensely. It felt like the world was collapsing as she experienced a jarring sensation. Her body involuntarily tilted to the side. Before she could regain her composure, the surroundings had already changed, and the place filled with corpses had vanished.

She slowly sat up, looking around in disbelief.

She found herself lying in a room filled with girlish and pink decor, with various sizes of stuffed animals piled nearby. There were also several sets of jk schoolgirl uniforms hanging on the side.

She covered her mouth and burst into tears.

She was back.

Su Lele knelt rigidly in place, and she could clearly sense that the environment around her had undergone a drastic change, as if she had been instantly transported from one place to another.

She suddenly turned around and noticed that the bodies that should have been lying around had all disappeared. She found herself in a small and unfamiliar room, just like in a dream. Everything in front of her seemed incredibly unreal.

This place…

Su Lele’s breathing quickened, and she trembled all over. She reached out to touch the wall behind her, but no matter how she felt it, it was a real, solid, and sturdy wall.

She leaned against the wall and crouched down, trembling all over, with both hands holding her head.

When she killed her boyfriend, she didn’t even flinch. When she knew she was going to be killed, she remained indifferent.

But at this moment, her expression seemed bewildered, and there was a hint of fear in her eyes that she couldn’t conceal.

It was completely different from her previous behavior.

The surroundings were perfectly square, like walls of solid copper and iron, with no windows and no furniture. It was an empty room, except for a locked iron door that confirmed it was a room.

Before she could react, the empty room began to change.

Out of thin air, a metal chair appeared in the place of the iron door. Seated on the chair was a middle-aged man with a large belly. His hands and feet were bound by sharp iron chains attached to the chair, which pierced his skin and flesh. To unlock them would surely mean tearing his skin and flesh apart.

His eyes were covered with a black cloth, and his head was pressed onto the table that was part of the chair. He couldn’t move.

Above his head, a gleaming, sharp ax dangled, ready to drop at any moment and sever the man’s body upon impact. The man’s mouth was gagged, rendering him unable to make any noises except for muffled swallowing sounds.

Su Lele’s reaction to seeing him was significant. She rolled off the floor, her eyes somewhat bloodshot, her fingers clenched into fists.

Before she could react, a cold, chilling voice echoed in the air.

“Do you hate him?”

Su Lele remained silent, her body trembling even more intensely, her eyes bulging. This completely exposed her innermost hatred.

“Do you want to get out of here alive?”

Su Lele’s face remained pale, her breathing quickening, expression twisting in a grotesque manner.

“Do you want to kill him or not?” The old man’s voice, like a devil’s whisper, continued to influence her inner thoughts.

Su Lele took a deep breath, clenching her jaw.

“Do you still remember this room?” The old man’s voice paused. “He’s the one who took your innocence here. Haven’t you been searching for him all these years?”

Su Lele’s fingernails dug into her own flesh. She could feel a sharp pain in her palm.

She wasn’t dreaming.

“Isn’t it because of him that you’ve become the way you are today? Hehehe.”

“Do you want him dead or not?”

“All you have to do is pull the rope next to you, and the ax will drop. Then, you can leave this place!”

The old man emitted a sinister chuckle, tinged with mockery. “Are you willing?”

Su Lele’s expression subtly changed.

“Nobody else will know about today’s events except us!”

So.

Are you willing?

However, whatever lies beyond that iron door is uncertain. Is it hope, endlessness, or even deeper despair?

Do you really think you’ve escaped the devil’s game?

Xiao Chen stood still in his place, observing the changes around him.

The man appeared behind him, his fingers slowly sliding down his waist.

The red candle flickered, gently swaying.

The two of them returned to the master bedroom where everyone had initially entered.

The man’s long hair was casually swept behind his ears, gracefully flowing down. He wore his usual red attire as the candlelight bathed him in an extremely elegant light.

The room was filled with red decorations, with the character “ 喜 ” that covered the entire room.

It matched the man’s attire perfectly.

Xiao Chen raised an eyebrow and turned around.

Jing Hezhi smiled and slowly removed the mask from Xiao Chen’s face, tossing it aside carelessly. With a firm grip, he held Xiao Chen’s slender waist and affectionately kissed his nose.

Xiao Chen still held a grudge against the paintings on the walls, only responding with a cold snort. “I had no idea you painted so many.”

Jing Hezhi choked up for a moment and then laughed. “Feelings have their own origins, deep and unwavering. You are the only one who occupies my thoughts.”

Xiao Chen wasn’t angry at all and was even less likely to say anything when he heard the man’s sweet words.

He reached behind to grasp the man’s neck, gazing at the room full of red decorations and double happiness symbols, then with a knowing tone, asked, “What do you intend to do in this room?”

The man pursed his lips, a playful smile forming at the corner of his mouth.

Jing Hezhi’s fingers rested at the small of Xiao Chen’s back, and his voice, teasing and not at all serious, responded, “Of course, it’s for the marriage consummation.”

Xiao Chen’s phoenix eyes slightly lifted, showing a smile filled with deep affection that couldn’t be hidden.

“I want to give you a formal ceremony. I want to hold a wedding with you,” Jing Hezhi’s voice was calm and unhurried.

Though Xiao Chen had guessed something like this when he first saw the room, hearing the man say it still touched his heart deeply. It was like something was tapping on Xiao Chen’s chest, slowly and gently, not causing pain but making him feel a strange sensation, a bittersweet feeling.

“All this time, my regret was that in every world, we couldn’t give each other a legitimate status or hold a wedding that belongs to you and me,” Jing Hezhi’s voice carried a hint of lingering tenderness.

This was also his ultimate goal in entering this new world.

Xiao Chen slightly opened his lips, but he didn’t speak. There was a faint redness in his eyes.

The next moment, Jing Hezhi brought out a set of red wedding attire, holding it in his hands.

The attire was extremely intricate, featuring cloud sleeves and motifs that resonated with the elements of what the man was wearing. It was adorned with patterns of roses and intertwining serpents, exactly matching the tattoo on Xiao Chen’s back.

“So,” the man pursed his lips, smiled, and said seriously, “Darling, are you willing to hold this ceremony with me tonight?”

It may sound like a request for the young man’s opinion, but in this world, no one would understand Xiao Chen better than Jing Hezhi. His darling wouldn’t be able to refuse his request.

In each dimension, the happiness worth cherishing was that they aged together, enduring every remaining life together.

However, the regret that remained in each world, was that they never officially tied the knot or held a ceremony signifying that they would be lifelong partners. Even in the previous dimension, where they exchanged rings, there was no proper process.

Xiao Chen pursed his lips, buried his head in the man’s chest, and then nodded slightly, tightly holding the man’s neck with both hands. He may seem calm on the surface, but only the man knew that his darling was trembling all over.

Jing Hezhi carefully kissed the top of Xiao Chen’s head, filled with a touch of tenderness.

Love you.

The process of changing clothes was quite tantalizing. Xiao Chen didn’t undress himself, nor did he dress himself. It was all done by the man instead.

The man’s slender fingers kept caressing Xiao Chen’s skin, as if admiring a beautiful work of art. It was as though a highly disciplined venomous snake was observing its prey, patiently waiting to devour its feast.

Ironically, it was Xiao Chen who found himself increasingly uncomfortable due to the man’s teasing. He was enchanted by the man’s charming face, making his heart itch, the urge to pounce on him stronger than ever.

He didn’t know how long it took to put on the clothes, but Xiao Chen felt like he had been teased beyond measure.

The man only raised the corner of his mouth and tied the belt around Xiao Chen’s waist, looking satisfyingly at the young man in his arms.

The red attire on the young man’s body emphasized his flawless skin, giving him an air of elegance.

His long neck was exposed, and his phoenix eyes slightly upturned, carrying an unmistakable allure.

The reflection in those eyes, illuminated by the red candles, seemed to depict only the figure of the man himself.

Jing Hezhi’s Adam’s apple rolled slightly.

It was more beautiful than he had imagined.

The man held Xiao Chen’s hand and led him outside, slowly opening and closing the door.

Outside the door was no desolate or empty scene; it was a great surprise that awaited Xiao Chen. The courtyard’s layout had also changed, with several round banquet tables added.

Surprisingly, there were people sitting in chairs, enjoying food and conversation, all dressed in vibrant clothes and appearing cheerful.

“………”

Xiao Chen gazed at the ground under their feet, and it appeared as if they were all floating in the air.

These were not people but clearly a group of spirits.

However, they all looked human-like, without the unattractive appearance of the dead or faces as pale as zombies. From a distance, they indeed looked like an ordinary group attending a wedding.

Xiao Chen and Jing Hezhi were both men, and even though Xiao Chen was the 0, there was no need to cover his head in red. They both confidently revealed their faces, wearing the same style of red attire as the man.

The elderly woman from before, who had shown various loving and caring looks towards Xiao Chen, was sitting below, smiling as she watched the two men come out of the door.

The scene before them was almost too beautiful, making Xiao Chen feel a bit reserved. He raised his head and met the man’s gaze, his heart rate seemed to accelerate inexplicably.

The man smiled and led Xiao Chen forward step by step.

The elderly woman stood up from her chair, holding a long red ribbon in her hand. She walked towards the two of them.

The ribbon was quite long, with two ball-shaped decorations that resembled flowers.

Jing Hezhi took what the elderly woman handed to him, and with a subtle smile, he gently helped Xiao Chen tie it around his wrist. He then gazed at the young man with a playful expression.

Xiao Chen hesitated for a moment but quickly understood what the woman meant. He imitated the man’s actions and tied it around the man’s wrist, doing it skillfully.

Two hearts forever united.

The audience erupted into thunderous applause. The spectators’ expressions were not stiff, and they didn’t seem awkward with each other. It all appeared quite normal, and there were even a few children quietly enjoying the delicious dishes laid out on the tables.

Facing each other, Xiao Chen and Jing Hezhi, led by the man, bowed to each other four times.

In ancient Chinese weddings, three bows were customary: the first to heaven and earth, the second to the ancestors, and the third to their parents. The final bow was between the bride and groom.

However, since neither of them had parents and they didn’t believe in heaven, earth, or deities, they skipped the formalities.

They had each other, and that was enough.

So these four bows were meant for each other. There was a glint in the man’s eyes, and a smile in Xiao Chen’s.

The man raised an eyebrow, motioning for Xiao Chen to lean closer.

In this pleasant atmosphere, Xiao Chen was expecting the man to say something to set the mood, so he looked at him with bright eyes, leaning his ear in.

However, to his surprise, the man’s voice was husky, with an unmistakable seductive tone, as he said, “The ceremony is over, shall we go to the bridal chamber?”

Heh, this old man.
